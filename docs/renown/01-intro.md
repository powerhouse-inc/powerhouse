# Intro to Renown

Renown is Powerhouse's decentralized identity and reputation system designed to address the challenge of trust within DAOs, where contributors often operate under pseudonyms. In traditional organizations, personal identity and reputation are key to establishing trust and accountability. Renown replicates this dynamic in the digital space, allowing contributors to earn experience and build reputation without revealing their real-world identities.

## Decentralised identifiers & Verifiable Credentials

At its core, Renown uses **decentralized identifiers and credentials**, enabling contributors to sign actions and contributions with their digital identity (tethered to Ethereum addresses), ensuring verifiable proof of their work. This reputation system incentivizes value-aligned behavior through gamification rewards, fostering collaboration without the need for direct management oversight. Over time, contributors can share their pseudonymous profiles with other organizations as cryptographic resumes, helping to secure new opportunities while maintaining privacy.

By enabling trust and accountability in a pseudonymous environment, Renown strengthens decentralized collaboration and contributes to the scalability and efficiency of DAOs and open organisations.
