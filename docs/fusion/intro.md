# Fusion Intro

Fusion is a public platform for publishing your organisational data. 
With the help of dashboards, modules & widgets Fusion helps organizations to structure and summarize data to make informed decisions.
The first implementation of Fusion is live for the [Sky ecosystem.](https://fusion.sky.money)

## Core features of Fusion 

#### Publish data to a public collaboration platform
Data which your organization is collecting in the Powerhouse native apps such as Connect & Switchboard or other data streams will be turned into actionable & verifiable insights with Fusion. Fusion is intended as a public collaboration platform to harvest feedback on organizational data, milestones and projects amongst others. 

#### Verifiability and auditing of organisational date
With the help of Renown & Connect a verification trail can be reviewed on the collaborative documents running in Fusion & Connect. Progress, ownership and status of different key initiatives can be tracked via the public dashboard of Fusion. 

### Getting started with Fusion
As we're expanding the feature scope of Fusion gradually beyond the Sky Ecosystem we're welcoming new business partners to discuss their organizational needs via our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/h7GKvqDyDP)
