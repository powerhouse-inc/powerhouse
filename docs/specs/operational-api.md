# Operational API Specification

## Goals

- Provide a type-safe, ergonomic API for querying a local operational database from TypeScript and React applications.
- Support subscribing to a query, to receive live updates when the underlying data changes.
- Enable developers to build and share queries, decoupling query construction from execution.
- Make it easy for an external package to expose a query builder of the operational tables it manages.

## Usage Overview

An external package can define an Operational Processor that listens for operations and populates custom tables on an SQL database.
Developers can then query those tables by importing a query builder from the external package. This instance is used to build type-safe queries for the tables managed by that package. These query objects are then passed to TS methods or React hooks, such as `useOperationalQuery` or `subscribeQuery`, which execute the queries on the operational database instance provided by the host app (e.g., via React context or other type of dependency injection).

This approach allows developers to:

- Create custom views of the operational data to support specific use cases.
- Build queries anywhere in their codebase or even in shared packages, without needing access to the database connection.
- Share and reuse query logic across different parts of an application or between packages.
- Retrieve query results in React components with type safety, loading, and error handling.

## Data

The system manages access to operational tables defined by external packages. Data flows as follows:

- **Definition**: Tables and their types are defined by an operational processor on an external package and exported as a TypeScript schema.
- **Setup**: Processors define a `setup` method where they can create the tables on the operational database or apply migrations if needed.
- **Population**: Processor listens to operations and populates the tables.
- **Query Building**: Query objects are constructed using the query builder provided by the external package. These objects are serializable and do not require a live database connection.
- **Query Execution**: React hooks such as `useOperationalQuery` receive query objects, execute them against the real database, and return the results to the component.

## Interfaces and Abstractions

### Core API

The Core API provides framework-agnostic primitives for building and executing queries against the operational database. It is designed for use in TypeScript/JavaScript environments, independent of React or any UI framework.

#### Query Builder

- Offers a type-safe API to build a query and outputs a compiled query compatible with the operational database Query Execution API. Output can be as simple as a string with a raw SQL query.
- Exported from a PH package.
- Used only for building queries; cannot execute them.

The actual Query Builder API exported by a package will depend on it's implementation. It is expected to be type-safe, according to the DB schema, but can just be a simple method that returns a string with a SQL query.
A good example is Kysely: https://kysely.dev/docs/recipes/splitting-query-building-and-execution

**Example:**

```ts
import { DB } from "package/custom-operational-db"; // kysely based implementation

const query = DB.selectFrom("person").select("first_name").where("id", "=", id);
```

#### Query Execution

##### One-off Query

```ts
db.query<T extends CompiledQuery>(query: T): Promise<InferResult<T>[]>
```

- Executes the provided query builder object against the operational database.
- Returns a promise of the typed result set.

##### Subscription Query

```ts
db.subscribeQuery<T extends CompiledQuery>(
  query: T,
  callback: (rows: InferResult<T>[]) => void
): UnsubscribeFn
```

- Subscribes to changes for the provided query.
- Calls the callback with updated results whenever the underlying data changes.
- Returns an unsubscribe function.

### React API

The React API wraps the Core API to provide idiomatic hooks for use in React components. These hooks handle state, effects, and cleanup automatically.

#### useOperationalQuery

```ts
function useOperationalQuery<T extends CompiledQuery>(
  query: T,
): {
  data: InferResult<T>[] | undefined;
  loading: boolean;
  error: Error | undefined;
};
```

- Executes a static query and manages loading/error state.

**Usage Example:**

```ts
import { PackageDB } from "package/custom-operational-db";

function PersonView({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const { data, loading, error } = useOperationalQuery(
    PackageDB.selectFrom("person").selectAll().where("id", "=", id),
  );
  // ...
}
```

#### useSubscribeQuery

```ts
function useSubscribeQuery<T extends CompiledQuery>(
  query: T,
): {
  data: InferResult<T>[] | undefined;
  loading: boolean;
  error: Error | undefined;
};
```

- Subscribes to live updates for the query and manages state.

**Usage Example:**

```ts
function LivePersonList() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useSubscribeQuery(
    PackageDB.selectFrom("person").selectAll(),
  );
  // ...
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### System Hotspots Analysis

#### Memory Usage Hotspots

**Query Result Caching**
- **Impact**: Large result sets from operational queries can consume significant memory, especially when multiple components subscribe to the same data
- **Evidence**: React applications commonly cache query results to avoid redundant database calls, leading to memory accumulation
- **Mitigation**: Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with configurable size limits and TTL (Time To Live) policies

**Subscription Management**
- **Impact**: Active subscriptions maintain references to query results and callback functions, preventing garbage collection
- **Evidence**: Each `useSubscribeQuery` hook creates a subscription that persists until component unmount
- **Mitigation**: Automatic cleanup of unused subscriptions, subscription deduplication for identical queries

**Query Builder Objects**
- **Impact**: Compiled query objects may retain references to large datasets during query construction
- **Evidence**: Complex queries with joins and aggregations can build intermediate result sets
- **Mitigation**: Implement query object serialization to reduce memory footprint, lazy evaluation of query parts

#### CPU Usage Hotspots

**Query Compilation and Type Inference**
- **Impact**: Type-safe query builders require complex type inference at build time and runtime
- **Evidence**: Kysely and similar ORMs show measurable compilation overhead for complex queries
- **Mitigation**: Query result caching, pre-compiled query templates for common patterns

**Real-time Subscription Processing**
- **Impact**: Processing database change events and notifying all subscribers requires CPU cycles
- **Evidence**: Each data change triggers callback execution across all active subscriptions
- **Mitigation**: Batch subscription updates, debounced notifications, subscription filtering

**React Re-renders**
- **Impact**: Frequent data updates can trigger excessive component re-renders
- **Evidence**: Each subscription callback triggers React state updates and potential re-renders
- **Mitigation**: React.memo optimization, useMemo for expensive computations, selective re-rendering

#### Network Usage Hotspots

**Database Connection Pooling**
- **Impact**: Multiple concurrent queries and subscriptions require database connections
- **Evidence**: Each query execution and subscription requires a database connection
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling, connection reuse for similar queries, connection limits

**Subscription Overhead**
- **Impact**: Real-time subscriptions maintain persistent connections to the database
- **Evidence**: Each subscription requires a dedicated database connection or change notification stream
- **Mitigation**: Subscription multiplexing, connection sharing, efficient change detection

### Decision Making Framework

**Performance Monitoring**
- Implement metrics collection for query execution time, memory usage, and subscription count
- Use performance profiling to identify bottlenecks in query compilation and execution
- Monitor database connection pool utilization and query patterns

**Caching Strategy**
- Cache query results based on query complexity and frequency
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation based on data change patterns
- Use different cache strategies for read-heavy vs write-heavy workloads

**Subscription Optimization**
- Implement subscription deduplication for identical queries across components
- Use subscription batching to reduce database load during high-frequency updates
- Implement subscription limits per component to prevent resource exhaustion

### Specific Mitigations

**Memory Management**
```typescript
// Example: LRU Cache Implementation
interface QueryCache {
  maxSize: number;
  ttl: number;
  evictLRU(): void;
  get(key: string): QueryResult | null;
  set(key: string, result: QueryResult): void;
}
```

**Subscription Optimization**
```typescript
// Example: Subscription Deduplication
class SubscriptionManager {
  private subscriptions = new Map<string, Set<Callback>>();
  
  subscribe(query: CompiledQuery, callback: Callback): UnsubscribeFn {
    const key = this.getQueryKey(query);
    if (!this.subscriptions.has(key)) {
      this.subscriptions.set(key, new Set());
      this.createDatabaseSubscription(query);
    }
    this.subscriptions.get(key)!.add(callback);
    return () => this.unsubscribe(key, callback);
  }
}
```

**Query Compilation Caching**
```typescript
// Example: Pre-compiled Query Templates
class QueryCompiler {
  private templateCache = new Map<string, CompiledQuery>();
  
  compile(query: QueryBuilder): CompiledQuery {
    const template = this.getQueryTemplate(query);
    if (this.templateCache.has(template)) {
      return this.templateCache.get(template)!;
    }
    const compiled = this.compileQuery(query);
    this.templateCache.set(template, compiled);
    return compiled;
  }
}
```

### Benchmarking Requirements

**Query Performance Benchmarks**
- Measure query compilation time for complex queries with joins and aggregations
- Benchmark query execution time for various result set sizes (1K, 10K, 100K rows)
- Test subscription notification latency under different load conditions

**Memory Usage Benchmarks**
- Measure memory consumption with 100+ active subscriptions
- Test memory usage patterns during rapid data updates
- Benchmark cache efficiency and memory overhead

**Scalability Benchmarks**
- Test system performance with concurrent users (10, 100, 1000+)
- Measure database connection pool utilization under load
- Benchmark React component re-render frequency and performance impact

**Benchmark Metrics**
- Query compilation time (ms)
- Query execution time (ms)
- Memory usage per subscription (MB)
- Subscription notification latency (ms)
- Database connection utilization (%)
- React re-render frequency (per second)

## Security

### Threat Model and Risk Assessment

The Operational API system faces several security challenges due to its role as a data access layer for operational databases. This section analyzes the worst-case scenarios and mitigation strategies.

#### Worst-Case Scenarios

**1. Malicious Query Injection**
- **Scenario**: An attacker gains access to the query building system and constructs malicious queries that could:
  - Extract sensitive data from operational tables
  - Perform denial-of-service attacks through resource-intensive queries
  - Bypass access controls through query manipulation
- **Impact**: Data breach, system performance degradation, unauthorized data access
- **Affected Parties**: All users of the system, potentially external systems if data is exfiltrated

**2. Database Access Control Bypass**
- **Scenario**: An attacker circumvents the role-based access control system to:
  - Access operational data beyond their permission level
  - Modify or delete critical operational data
  - Access data from other users or organizations
- **Impact**: Data integrity compromise, privacy violations, potential regulatory violations
- **Affected Parties**: Individual users, organizations, system administrators

**3. Subscription-Based Attacks**
- **Scenario**: An attacker exploits the real-time subscription system to:
  - Create excessive subscriptions to exhaust system resources
  - Intercept real-time data streams
  - Perform timing attacks to infer sensitive information
- **Impact**: System resource exhaustion, data leakage, performance degradation
- **Affected Parties**: All system users, infrastructure

**4. Authentication/Authorization Compromise**
- **Scenario**: An attacker gains unauthorized access through:
  - Compromised wallet credentials (DID/private keys)
  - Exploitation of the Renown authentication system
  - Bypass of Switchboard verification mechanisms
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise, unauthorized data access, potential data manipulation
- **Affected Parties**: All users, system infrastructure, external integrations

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. SQL Injection Prevention

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Direct database access through query execution

**Mitigation**:
- **Type-Safe Query Builders**: All queries must be constructed using type-safe query builders (e.g., Kysely) that prevent raw SQL injection
- **Query Validation**: Implement strict validation of compiled queries before execution
- **Parameter Binding**: Ensure all user inputs are properly parameterized
- **Query Whitelisting**: Maintain a registry of allowed query patterns and validate against this whitelist

```typescript
// Example: Type-safe query construction
const query = DB.selectFrom("person")
  .select("first_name")
  .where("id", "=", userId); // Type-safe, no SQL injection possible

// Example: Query validation
function validateQuery(query: CompiledQuery): boolean {
  const allowedPatterns = getWhitelistedPatterns();
  return allowedPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.matches(query));
}
```

#### 2. Database Access Control

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Direct access to operational data

**Mitigation**:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement the existing RBAC system with three tiers:
  - **Guests**: Read-only access to public data
  - **Users**: Standard access to authorized data
  - **Admins**: Full access to all data and administrative functions
- **Row-Level Security**: Implement database-level row filtering based on user permissions
- **Query Scope Validation**: Validate that queries only access tables and data the user is authorized to see
- **Audit Logging**: Log all database access attempts and successful queries

```typescript
// Example: Row-level security implementation
interface QueryContext {
  user: {
    address: string;
    role: 'guest' | 'user' | 'admin';
    permissions: string[];
  };
}

function applyRowLevelSecurity(query: CompiledQuery, context: QueryContext): CompiledQuery {
  if (context.user.role === 'admin') return query;
  
  // Apply filters based on user permissions
  return query.where('owner_address', '=', context.user.address);
}
```

#### 3. Subscription Security

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Real-time data access

**Mitigation**:
- **Subscription Limits**: Implement per-user and per-query subscription limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limits to subscription creation and data updates
- **Subscription Validation**: Validate subscription queries against user permissions
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor subscription resource usage and implement automatic cleanup

```typescript
// Example: Subscription management with limits
class SubscriptionManager {
  private userSubscriptions = new Map<string, Set<string>>();
  private readonly MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PER_USER = 50;
  
  subscribe(userId: string, query: CompiledQuery): UnsubscribeFn {
    const userSubs = this.userSubscriptions.get(userId) || new Set();
    
    if (userSubs.size >= this.MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PER_USER) {
      throw new Error('Subscription limit exceeded');
    }
    
    // Validate query permissions
    this.validateQueryPermissions(userId, query);
    
    userSubs.add(query.id);
    this.userSubscriptions.set(userId, userSubs);
    
    return () => this.unsubscribe(userId, query.id);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Authentication and Authorization Security

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - System-wide access control

**Mitigation**:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Leverage the existing Renown DID-based authentication system
- **Credential Verification**: Implement strict verification of wallet signatures and DIDs
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with proper expiration
- **Access Token Validation**: Validate all access tokens through the Switchboard verification system

```typescript
// Example: Enhanced authentication validation
async function validateUserAccess(token: string, requiredRole: UserRole): Promise<boolean> {
  // Verify Renown credential
  const verified = await verifyAuthBearerToken(token);
  if (!verified) return false;
  
  // Check user role permissions
  const userRole = getUserRole(verified.verifiableCredential.credentialSubject.address);
  return hasPermission(userRole, requiredRole);
}
```

### Infrastructure Security

#### Database Security
- **Connection Encryption**: All database connections must use TLS/SSL encryption
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement secure connection pooling with proper authentication
- **Database Hardening**: Apply database security best practices (least privilege, regular updates)
- **Backup Security**: Ensure database backups are encrypted and securely stored

#### Network Security
- **API Gateway**: Implement an API gateway with rate limiting and DDoS protection
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications must use HTTPS
- **CORS Configuration**: Implement strict CORS policies
- **IP Whitelisting**: Consider IP-based access restrictions for sensitive operations

### Monitoring and Incident Response

#### Security Monitoring
- **Query Logging**: Log all database queries with user context and timing
- **Access Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual access patterns or privilege escalation attempts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor for resource exhaustion attacks
- **Error Tracking**: Track and alert on security-related errors

#### Incident Response
- **Automated Alerts**: Implement automated alerts for security incidents
- **Incident Playbook**: Maintain incident response procedures
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Ensure ability to trace and investigate security incidents
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document data recovery and system restoration procedures

### Compliance and Privacy

#### Data Protection

- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
- **Privacy Controls**: Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

#### Audit Requirements
- **Access Auditing**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs of all data access
- **Change Tracking**: Track all changes to operational data
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for regulatory requirements

### Security Testing

#### Penetration Testing
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct regular penetration testing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- **Code Security Reviews**: Perform security-focused code reviews
- **Third-Party Audits**: Engage third-party security auditors

#### Security Validation
- **Query Injection Testing**: Test all query building and execution paths
- **Access Control Testing**: Validate all access control mechanisms
- **Authentication Testing**: Test authentication and authorization flows
- **Performance Security Testing**: Test system behavior under attack conditions

### Why These Mitigations Matter

The Operational API system handles sensitive operational data that could include business-critical information, user data, and system configurations. A security breach could result in:

1. **Financial Loss**: Unauthorized access to financial or business data
2. **Reputational Damage**: Loss of trust from users and partners
3. **Regulatory Violations**: Non-compliance with data protection regulations
4. **System Compromise**: Potential compromise of the entire Powerhouse ecosystem

The multi-layered security approach ensures that even if one layer is compromised, additional layers provide defense in depth. The existing authentication system (Renown) and authorization framework (Switchboard) provide a solid foundation, but the operational database layer requires additional security measures due to its direct access to sensitive data.

By implementing these security measures, the system can maintain the trust of its users while providing the powerful operational data access capabilities that developers need to build robust applications.
