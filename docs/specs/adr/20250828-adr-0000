# ADR 0000: Introduce ADR Process with DailyBot + Zapier

- **Date:** 2025-08-28  

## Context
We want a consistent, lightweight way to capture and share important architectural decisions. Relying on chat threads (e.g. Discord) made it difficult to discover and reference decisions later.  

## Decision
We will maintain an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) log** inside the repository at `/docs/specs/adr/`. Each ADR is a markdown file with a unique identifier and follows a simple template.  

To reduce manual overhead, we connected **DailyBot** to **Zapier**. Team members can submit an ADR through a DailyBot form, and Zapier will automatically create a markdown file in `/docs/adr/` (via a GitHub pull request).  

## Consequences
- ADRs are version-controlled and reviewed alongside code.  
- The process is integrated into our existing workflows (Discord + GitHub).  
- Minimal manual work is required to keep the decision log up to date.  
- Future contributors will have a clear record of why key decisions were made.
