# Intro to Connect

Powerhouse Connect offers open organizations a hub to collaborate on your most important documents and processes. The underlying document synchronisation mechanism keeps files synchronised accross a number of different decentralized and centralized storage locations and embeds verifiable trails into the documents history. 

The first two implementations of Connect are currently live. Being the following: 
- **Real World Asset Reporting** for the [Sky ecosystem.](https://fusion.sky.money) which offers an insights in the Real World Asset portfolio's that are maintained for the Sky ecosystem. 
- **Grants Inventive Program Tracking** for [Arbitrum](https://arbgrants.com) which offers a grants tracking report for the grantee recipients of the Arbitrum LTIPP grant. 

## Connect's key features

- Connect functions as a private editor & contributor tool for contributors of open organisations. It allows teams to manage internal documents with full control over the data ownership. Connect is available as stand-alone desktop application or in the cloud.

- Connect offers a navigation menu for adding, synchronising and browsing document drives that are shared within an organisation or are private to the contributor. 

- Connect allows contributors to edit and work on different 'document model types' selected or defined by the organisation.
