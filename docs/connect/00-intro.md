# Intro to Connect

Powerhouse Connect offers a hub to open organizations for collaborating on their most important documents and processes. The underlying document synchronisation mechanism keeps files synchronised accross a number of different decentralized and centralized storage locations and embeds verifiable trails into the documents history. 

The first two implementations of Connect are currently live. Being the following: 
- **Real World Asset Reporting** for the [Sky ecosystem.](https://fusion.sky.money) which offers an insights in the Real World Asset portfolio's that are maintained for the Sky ecosystem. 
- **Grants Inventive Program Tracking** for [Arbitrum](https://arbgrants.com) which offers a grants tracking report for the grantee recipients of the Arbitrum LTIPP grant. 

## Connect's key features

1. **A private editor & contributor tool for contributors of open organisations.**
    
    It allows teams to manage internal documents with full control over the data ownership. Connect is available as stand-alone desktop application or in the cloud.

2. **Edit and work on different 'document models'** 
    
    Document models can be selected, customized or build from scratch by organisations and contributors who want to be in total control of their workflows and business domains. 

3. **A navigation menu for adding, synchronising and browsing documents** 

    Documents are the key technical primitive in connect and are shared within an organisation or are private to the contributor.

Functioning as a guide that helps you structure your work, ensuring all necessary steps are followed and information is captured correctly.
