# Launch a local Reactor

Now we'll create a local reactor instance to simulate the behaviour of the chatroom synchronising messages between two nodes or users in the network. 

Wind down connect and run the following command in your terminal. 
`npm run reactor`
This spins up a reactor, which represents a node that is usally hosted as a remote server, but in our case we run it locally on our machine. The reactor you've created will become available as a public drive in your left hand side bar. 

If you would now open up two different browser windows you will be able to login into two version of connect, with two different ethereum address to start validating the functionality of your chatroom. 

Please go ahead now and send a message to yourself, give yourself a thumbs up or try to make your ENS name appear as your profile when logging in. Also remind yourself that you are able to see the revision history of your document and all it's operation history in the top right corner. 

Congratulations! You've now explored one of the many ways to use document models within the powerhouse ecosystem.
