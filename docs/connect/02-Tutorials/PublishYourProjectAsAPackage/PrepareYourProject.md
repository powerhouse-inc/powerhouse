# Prepare Your Project
This tutorial is a step by step guide to help you understand the process of building a powerhouse project and publishing it as a package.

:::info
Let's start with some **key concepts** that will help you understand the process we're going to go through in this tutorial.

- **Powerhouse Project**: The construction site of your package: A project is build with document models and editors which you will publish to NPM as a package with modules.
- **Powerhouse Modules**: The modules that are part of your project, such as the document models, editors, processors or scripts
- **Powerhouse Package**: A package is a collection of modules that are published to NPM and can be installed on a server instance or locally on your machine. Different organizations can have different packages.

## 1. Building your project 

To start building your project with it's dedicated document models and editors we'll run the following command:

  ```bash
   pnpm create document-model-lib
   ```
This command will start the configuration of your powerhouse project. 

   > ðŸ’¡ For experimental features, use --version [version] which allows selecting a specific branch of our document-model-boilerplate. There are --dev, --staging and --main options. Select `pnpm create document-model-lib@dev --dev` to use the latest development version. Please be aware that this version can contain bugs and experimental features that aren't fully tested.

<summary>Do you need to reset your package manager cache?</summary>

If you need to reset your package manager, you can run the following commands for your package manager: (npm, yarn)

```bash
npx clear-npx-cache

npm cache verify
npm cache clean --force
npm cache verify

yarn cache list
yarn cache clean --force
yarn cache list
```
</details>

### 1.1. Specifying your project details

When you are creating your own project, you will be asked to name your project. 
Which will also become the package name when someone else wants to install it in a cloud environment via npm. 

Please feel free to navigate to the package.json file and fill in all the other available fields such as `name`, `version`, `author`, `license` and `main`.

  ```bash
{  
"name": "@your-org/package-name",  
"version": "1.0.0", 
"author": "Your Name",
"license": "AGPL-3.0-only",
"main": "index.js"  
}
```

Now that you've created your powerhouse project you are ready to generate the necessary directory and file structure to add your document models.

For this purpose you can use your preferred package manager, pnpm, bun, yarn or npm with the command. 
```bash
pnpm generate
```

### 1.2. Adding Document Models, editors and unit tests

Now that you've set up your directory. 
Go ahead and add the document models you'd like to add by going throught the standard document model building flow:
1. Defining your Document Model **GraphQL Schema** in the document model document editor. 
2. Defining your Document Model **Operations** in the document model document operations editor.
3. Generating the scaffolding code by **exporting** the Zip file from connect and **importing** it into your project. (Save it in the directory you've created in the previous step)
4. Implementing the **reducer code** and unit tests of your document models reducers.
5. Implementing the **document editors** to visualize and interact with your document models.
6. Run **unit tests** and verify the editor functionality via `npm run connect` for local testing.		  

### 1 .3. Verifying your project
Now that we've completed our directory with the reducers, tests and editors and your project is populated with modules we'll verify the build output and see if everything is working correctly. 

Let's verify the package build output with the following command:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will build the project and create a build directory with the output. The code gets optimized and minified. It optimizes the code for production and distribution so different environments can use it as a package.
```bash
pnpm serve
```

This command will start a local server and serve the build output.
Inspect the build output and verify that the document models are working correctly.

1.4 Storing your project in a git repository

Now that you've verified your project is working correctly, you can store your project in a git repository.
Why? 
- So you can track the changes of your project.
- You can collaborate with your team members.

If you stick to the layout generated by the `document-model-lib` command, where it's folders for document models and editors, you should later be able to use install your project with `ph install` once it's published to the npm registry.

```bash
git init
git add .
```

This will initialize a git repository and add all the files to the repository.


## 2. Publishing your project

Since you've already registered your organization on npm, you can now publish your project to the npm registry. 
Log in via the command line:
```bash
npm login
```

You'll be prompted for your username, password, and email in a seperate browser window. 

Once you've logged in, you can configure your package.json for npm before publishing. 
If you're publishing a package under a scope (like @your-org/my-package), you might need to add the `publishConfig` to ensure it's public, otherwise scoped packages default to private:

```json
{
  "name": "@your-org/my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

For the actual publishing step, run the following command to publish your project to the npm registry:
```bash
npm publish
```

Optionally, if you are publishing a scoped package and you want it public, run:
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Now let's verify that the package(s) get published in the package repository, next to pre-existing packages that you might have been publishing before. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## 3. Deploying the host apps & project.
Now that we've installed all the necessary services on our server instance, we can start deploying the host apps & our packaged project from npm.

Install your project package we've published earlier on your local connect instance by running the following command:

```bash
ph install @your-org/package-name
```
Alternatively you can also install the package in the setttings of Connect in the 'package manager' section. 
Where you'll be able to use the same package name as you've used in the `package.json` file and install it with a click of a button.
