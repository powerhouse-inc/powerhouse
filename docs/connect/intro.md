## A Private contributor tool

- Connect functions as a private editor & contributor tool for contributors of open organisations. It allows teams to manage internal documents with full control over the data ownership. Connect is available as stand-alone desktop application or in the cloud.

- Connect offers a navigation menu for adding, synchronising and browsing document drives that are shared within an organisation or are private to the contributor. 

- Connect allows contributors to edit and work on different 'document model types' selected or defined by the organisation. 

:::info
Think of Document Models as smart templates. Document Models are tools designed to assist and empower people working within DAOs. Functioning as a guide that helps you structure your work, ensuring all necessary steps are followed and information is captured correctly.

## Connecting with your first drive instances

### Adding a Public Drive

Get access to an organisations drive instances by adding this drive to your Connect Drive navigation tree. To add a new drive you'll have to get the correct URL for the drive. Both public drives and secure cloud drives will be offered as centralised and decentralised solutions in the future. 

### Adding a Secure Cloud Drive

A secure cloud drive is a drive storage instance that allows smaller teams or 'internal' teams of an open organisation or DAO to maintain control over sharing & editing rights. A secure cloud drive is not directly available and transparent for anyone with the link as it offers access gating. 

### Create a new Local Drive

Create a new local drive that is hosted on your local device and not shared with anyone else. This allows a user to work in private and push updates that are ready for publication to a Secure Cloud Drive of a Public Drive.

:::info
Each drive can be made 'Available offline' if you want to store a local copy of it and contribute to the decentralisation of an open organisations documents.
