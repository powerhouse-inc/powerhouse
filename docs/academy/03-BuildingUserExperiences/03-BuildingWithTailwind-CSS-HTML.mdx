# Building with Tailwind, CSS & HTML(WIP)

# Using Tailwind in Your Projects

## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to help developers style their applications quickly and efficiently. With the latest improvements in Tailwind v4, integrating it into **Powerhouse Projects** (Document Models + editors that can be published as a package) has become even simpler, eliminating the need for extra configuration files or manual CLI commands.

This guide outlines how to seamlessly use Tailwind in your project, leveraging TypeScript’s build system and modern development tools like Vite and Storybook.

## Installation and Setup
When working on a Powerhouse Project in Connect Studio (Running Connect Locally), projects will need the following configuration in their package.json to use Tailwind:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:css": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css",
  "build": "npm run build:css && tsc --build"
}
```
### How It Works:
**Tailwind CLI Compilation**

This command processes the input styles.css file and generates the compiled CSS in the dist folder.
Since Tailwind v4 detects the required styles automatically, there’s no need for additional configuration files.
```
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css
```


**TypeScript Compilation**

```
tsc --build
```
This command handles all TypeScript-related tasks, including code compilation, type checking, and code splitting.
The `--build` flag enables caching of build artifacts across the monorepo, optimizing performance.

**Automatic Tailwind Detection (No More Config Files!)**  
With Tailwind v4, the framework automatically detects the necessary CSS classes from your source code.   
This means:
- No need for postcss.config.js
- No need for a tailwind.config.js file
- Configuration is handled entirely through CSS variables

Tailwind now uses CSS for configuration, so importing styles from the Powerhouse Design System automatically applies the necessary theme and settings.

**Customizing the Design System**  
Projects using a design system can override specific styles by defining CSS variables with the same name. This provides a flexible way to extend or modify themes without additional Tailwind configuration.

**Integrating Tailwind with Storybook**  
Since Storybook uses Vite under the hood, integrating Tailwind requires minimal setup. To enable automatic Tailwind compilation when running Storybook, update the .storybook/main.ts file:

```ts
// .storybook/main.ts
viteFinal: async (config) => {
    const { mergeConfig } = await import('vite');
    const { default: tailwindcss } = await import("@tailwindcss/vite");
    return mergeConfig(config, {
      plugins: [tailwindcss()],
    });
  },
```
Then, simply import the styles in .storybook/preview.ts:

```ts
// .storybook/preview.ts
import "../styles.css";
```
This setup ensures that Storybook automatically compiles Tailwind styles, without requiring additional CLI commands.

## Using Tailwind in Connect Studio
For Connect Studio, the process is similar to Storybook:

**Install the Tailwind Vite plugin**  
Ensure the Tailwind Vite plugin is added to the project configuration.

**Define the Styles Directory for Installed Packages**  
To make styles accessible across different packages, store them in a consistent location such as `package/{editorsDir}/styles.css`.
This ensures that editors and components can import the correct styles with minimal effort.

:::info
**Summary**   
- Tailwind v4 simplifies setup by removing the need for configuration files.
- Tailwind styles are automatically detected by the CLI, requiring only a CSS import.
- TypeScript (tsc --build) manages the entire build process efficiently.
- Storybook and Connect Studio can integrate Tailwind with zero manual CSS builds using the Tailwind Vite plugin.
