## Cleaning and Updating ph-cmd

If you need to perform a clean reinstallation of the Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`), follow these steps:

1. First, uninstall the global ph-cmd package:
```bash
pnpm uninstall -g ph-cmd
```

2. Remove the Powerhouse configuration directory:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.ph
```

3. Reinstall the CLI tool (choose one):
```bash
# For the stable version
pnpm install -g ph-cmd

# For the staging version
pnpm install -g ph-cmd@staging

# For a specific version
pnpm install -g ph-cmd@<version>
```

This process ensures a clean slate by removing both the CLI tool and its configuration files before installing the desired version. It's particularly useful when:
- Troubleshooting CLI issues
- Upgrading to a new version
- Switching between stable and staging versions
- Resolving configuration conflicts
