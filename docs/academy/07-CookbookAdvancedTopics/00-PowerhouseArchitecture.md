# Powerhouse Architecture

The Powerhouse ecosystem is built on **five core host applications** that together form a **modular, scalable operating system** for decentralized organizations. Each application serves a distinct role, yet they are deeply interdependent, working as a unified system to **streamline operations, enhance collaboration, and drive automation**.

These five applications are:

1. **Connect** – The contributor’s public or private workspace.
2. **Switchboard** – The data infrastructure and API engine.
3. **Fusion** – The public-facing collaboration hub.
4. **Renown** – The decentralized reputation and identity system.
5. **Academy** – The onboarding and learning platform.

Each application is designed to be **modular yet complementary**, ensuring **smooth data flows, structured collaboration, and scalable automation**. The functionality of the 5 host apps offers a completely integrated experience for running decentralized operation. 

## **How the Five Applications Work Together**

The Powerhouse ecosystem functions as a **decentralized operating system**, where each of the **four core applications** works in synergy to ensure **seamless collaboration, structured data management, and automated workflows**. Each application has a **distinct purpose**, yet their **interconnectivity** is what makes the system truly powerful.

### **1. Connect: The Contributor’s Workspace and Data Capture Point**

Connect is the **entry point** for individual contributors, where they install **apps and packages** tailored to specific business solutions, enabling collaboration in **public or private settings**.

- All work in Connect is captured as **document models**, ensuring that **data is structured, traceable, and immediately available** for processing.
- This structured data flows into **Switchboard**, making it accessible for analytics, automation, and API-driven integrations.
- **Fusion** then utilizes this data to generate **dashboards, summaries, and insights** for decision-making.
- **Renown** serves as the **authentication and access gateway**, ensuring that contributors can securely interact with the system.

### **2. Switchboard: The Data Processing and Automation Engine**

Switchboard acts as the **central nervous system**, ensuring that **data flows** efficiently between applications and powers **real-time coordination**.

- It **ingests structured data** from **Connect** and makes it available for further **analysis, automation, and integrations**.
- The **API interface** allows developers and data engineers to **fuel the broader system**, providing insights and feeding data-driven workflows.
- The processed data is then **transmitted to Fusion**, where it is transformed into **dashboards, analytics, and key performance indicators (KPIs)**.

### **3. Fusion: The Public Collaboration and Data Visualization Layer**

Fusion serves as the **public-facing marketplace and collaboration hub**, allowing contributors and organizations to **interact with structured data** captured from **Connect and processed through Switchboard**.

- Fusion **structures, summarizes, and visualizes** key metrics, enabling users to **make data-driven decisions**.
- It pulls **relevant operational insights**, helping stakeholders navigate and **act on real-time data**.
- Users can directly **access work completed in Connect**, viewing reports, summaries, and discussions within Fusion’s **public and private environments**.

### **4. Renown: Authentication, Reputation, and Access Control**

Renown is the **trust and identity layer**, ensuring **security, reputation tracking, and access control** across the ecosystem.

- It acts as the **authentication gateway**, determining **who has permission to view, edit, or execute specific operations** within the system.
- Every action performed in **Connect** is **tracked in the document history**, making it fully auditable through **Switchboard**.
- Fusion utilizes Renown to **verify contributor credibility**, ensuring that data-driven decisions are based on **trusted and authenticated inputs**.
