## Prerequisites
- Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`) installed
- Terminal or command prompt access

## Solution

### Step 1: (Optional) Remove Existing Configuration
If you suspect issues with your current global setup or want a completely clean slate, remove the existing global configuration directory. **Skip this if setting up for the first time.**
```bash
# Use with caution: this removes your global settings and downloaded dependencies.
rm -rf ~/.ph
```

### Step 2: Set Up Global Defaults
Initialize the default global project configuration.
```bash
ph setup-globals
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Switch to a Specific Environment (e.g., Staging)
If you need to use non-production dependencies, switch the global environment.
```bash
# Switch to staging dependencies
ph use staging

# Or switch back to the latest stable versions
# ph use latest
```

## Expected Outcome
- A `~/.ph` directory is created or reset.
- The global project is configured, potentially using the specified environment (e.g., staging).
- You are ready to initialize or work with Powerhouse projects using the defined global settings.

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Issue: Commands fail after removing `~/.ph`.
  - Solution: Ensure you run `ph setup-globals` afterwards.
- Issue: Need to use specific local dependencies globally.
  - Solution: Use `ph use local /path/to/local/packages`.

pnpm install -g ph-cmd
```

### Step 2: Configure PATH for Global Binaries
For yarn and bun, you need to add their global binary directories to your PATH:

#### For Yarn:
```bash
# Add this to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent
export PATH="$PATH:$(yarn global bin)"
```

#### For Bun:
```bash
# Add this to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bun/bin"
```

After adding these lines, reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check that the CLI is properly installed and accessible:
```bash
ph-cmd --version
```

### Step 4: Using Different Package Managers in Projects
When working with Powerhouse projects, you can specify your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Initialize a project with npm
ph init --package-manager npm

# Initialize a project with yarn
ph init --package-manager yarn

# Initialize a project with bun
ph init --package-manager bun

# Initialize a project with pnpm (preferred default)
ph init --package-manager pnpm
```

## Expected Outcome
- Powerhouse CLI installed and accessible through your preferred package manager
- Ability to manage Powerhouse projects using your chosen package manager
- Proper PATH configuration for global binaries

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Issue: Command not found after installation
  - Solution: Ensure the global binary directory is in your PATH (especially for yarn and bun)
  - Solution: Try running the command with the full path to verify installation
- Issue: Permission errors during installation
  - Solution: Use `sudo` on Unix-based systems or run as administrator on Windows
- Issue: Package manager conflicts
  - Solution: Stick to one package manager per project to avoid lockfile conflicts

<details id="running-connect-with-https-and-a-custom-port">
<summary>Running Connect with HTTPS and a Custom Port</summary>

## How to Run Connect with HTTPS and a Custom Port
---

## Problem Statement
You need to run the local Powerhouse Connect application using HTTPS, possibly on a different port than the default, for scenarios like testing on a remote server (e.g., EC2) or complying with specific network requirements.

## Prerequisites
- Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`) installed
- A Powerhouse project initialized (`ph init`)
- Potentially, valid SSL/TLS certificates if running in a non-localhost environment that requires trusted HTTPS. (The `--https` flag may use self-signed certificates for local development).

## Solution

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
Ensure your terminal is in the root directory of your Powerhouse project.
```bash
cd <yourprojectname>
```

### Step 2: Run Connect with Flags
Execute the `ph connect` command, adding the `--https` flag to enable HTTPS and the `--port` flag followed by the desired port number.
```bash
# Example using port 8442
ph connect --port 8442 --https
```

### Step 3: Access Connect
Open your web browser and navigate to the specified address. Remember to use `https` and include the custom port.
```
https://<your-hostname-or-ip>:<port>
# Example: https://localhost:8442
# Example: https://my-ec2-instance-ip:8442
```
You might encounter a browser warning about the self-signed certificate; you may need to accept the risk to proceed for local/development testing.

## Expected Outcome
- The Powerhouse Connect application starts and serves traffic over HTTPS on the specified port.
- You can access the Connect interface securely using the `https` protocol.

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Issue: Browser shows security warnings (e.g., "Your connection is not private").
  - Solution: This is expected when using the default self-signed certificate generated by `--https`. For development or internal testing, you can usually proceed by accepting the risk. For production or public-facing scenarios, configure Connect with properly signed certificates (consult Powerhouse documentation for advanced configuration).
- Issue: Port conflict (e.g., `"Port <port> is already in use"`).
  - Solution: Choose a different port number that is not currently occupied by another application.
- Issue: Cannot access Connect from a remote machine.
  - Solution: Ensure the port is open in any firewalls (on the server and potentially network firewalls). Verify you are using the correct public IP address or hostname of the machine running Connect.

You have a Powerhouse document model and need to create a user interface (editor) for it to be used within the Connect application.

## Prerequisites
- Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`) installed
- A Powerhouse project initialized (`ph init`)
- A document model generated or defined within the project (e.g., in the `document-models` directory).

## Solution

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
Ensure your terminal is in the root directory of your Powerhouse project.
```bash
cd <yourprojectname>
```

### Step 2: Generate the Editor Template
Run the `generate` command, specifying the editor name (usually matching the document model name) and the associated document type.

```bash
# Replace <ModelName> with the name of your document model (e.g., ToDoList)
# Replace <docType> with the identifier for your document (e.g., powerhouse/todolist)
ph generate --editor <ModelName> --document-types <docType>
```

## Expected Outcome
- A new directory is created under `editors/` (e.g., `editors/<model-name>/`).
- An `editor.tsx` file is generated within that directory, containing a basic template for your document editor.
- You can now customize `editor.tsx` to build your desired UI using HTML, Tailwind CSS, or custom CSS.

**For npm packages:**
```bash
# Replace <your-package-name> with the actual name on npm
ph install <your-package-name>
```

**For local packages (using a relative or absolute path):**
```bash
# Example using a relative path
ph install ../path/to/my-local-package

# Example using an absolute path
ph install /Users/you/dev/my-local-package
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check your project's `package.json` and `powerhouse.manifest.json` to ensure the package dependency has been added correctly. Run `ph connect` to see if the components from the installed package are available.

## Expected Outcome
- The custom Powerhouse package is downloaded and installed into your project's dependencies.
- The `powerhouse.manifest.json` is updated (if necessary) to reflect the installed package.
- Document models, editors, drive explorers, or other components from the package become available within the target project.

<details id="managing-powerhouse-dependencies-and-versions">
<summary>Managing Powerhouse Dependencies and Versions</summary>

## How to Manage Powerhouse Dependencies and Versions
---
> **Note:** This is a temporary solution until version control is fully implemented in Powerhouse. Future updates may change how dependencies are managed.

## Problem Statement
You need to understand and manage different types of dependencies in your Powerhouse project, including:
- Monorepo dependencies (from the Powerhouse core repository)
- Project-specific dependencies (from published npm packages)
- Boilerplate dependencies

## Prerequisites
- Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`) installed
- A Powerhouse project initialized (`ph init`)
- npm account (if you need to publish packages)

## Solution

### Understanding Different Types of Dependencies

1. **Monorepo Dependencies**
   - The Powerhouse monorepo has three main branches:
     - `main` (stable)
     - `dev` (development)
     - `staging` (pre-release)
   - You can use these branches by:
     ```bash
     # Install dev version of CLI
     pnpm install -g ph-cmd@dev
     
     # Initialize project with dev dependencies
     ph init --dev
     ```

2. **Project Dependencies**
   - These are dependencies from published npm packages
   - Update them using:
     ```bash
     # Update to latest stable versions
     ph use
     
     # Update to development versions
     ph use dev
     
     # Update to production versions
     ph use prod
     ```

3. **Publishing Updated Dependencies**
   - If you make changes to dependencies, you need to:
     1. Update the dependencies in your project
     2. Publish the updated package to npm
     3. Other projects will then get the new version when they run `ph install`

### Important Notes

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - Currently, updating Connect versions might break older packages
   - Always test thoroughly after updating dependencies
   - Consider publishing to a private npm registry for testing

2. **Local Development**
   - Using `ph use` in a project folder only affects that specific project
   - Other projects will still download the latest published version from npm
   - For testing, you can publish to your own npm account

## Expected Outcome
- Clear understanding of different dependency types
- Ability to manage and update dependencies appropriately
- Knowledge of when to publish updated packages

## Common Issues and Solutions
- Issue: Dependencies not updating as expected
  - Solution: Ensure you're using the correct `ph use` command for your needs
- Issue: Breaking changes after updates
  - Solution: Test thoroughly and consider publishing to a private npm registry first
- Issue: Confusion about which version is being used
  - Solution: Check your package.json and powerhouse.manifest.json for current versions

Data Synchronisation Recipes

<details id="troubleshooting-document-syncing">
<summary>Troubleshooting Document Syncing: Supergraph vs. Drive Endpoints</summary>

## Troubleshooting Document Syncing: Supergraph vs. Drive Endpoints
---

## Problem Statement
You've created or modified documents within a specific drive using Powerhouse Connect, but when you query the main GraphQL endpoint (`http://localhost:4001/graphql`), you don't see the changes or the documents you expected. This can lead to confusion about whether data is being synced correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Powerhouse CLI (`ph-cmd`) installed.
- A Powerhouse project initialized (`ph init`).
- The Powerhouse Reactor is running (`ph reactor`).
- Powerhouse Connect is running (`ph connect`).
- You have attempted to create or modify documents in a drive (e.g., a "finances" drive).

## Solution

Understanding the different GraphQL endpoints in Powerhouse is crucial for effective troubleshooting:

1.  **The Supergraph Endpoint (`http://localhost:4001/graphql`):**
    *   This is the main entry point for the supergraph, which combines various subgraphs (e.g., system information, user accounts, etc.).
    *   While you can query many things here, it's generally **not** the endpoint for direct, real-time document content operations like `pushUpdates` for a specific drive.

2.  **Drive-Specific Endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:4001/d/<driveId>` or `http://localhost:4001/d/<driveId>/graphql`):**
    *   Each drive (e.g., "finances", "mydocs") has its own dedicated endpoint.
    *   Operations that modify or directly interact with the content of a specific drive, such as creating new documents or pushing updates, are typically handled by this endpoint.
    *   When you interact with documents in Powerhouse Connect, it communicates with these drive-specific endpoints.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Correct Endpoint:**
    *   As illustrated in the scenario where a user was looking for documents in a "finances" drive, the key realization was needing to interact with the `http://localhost:4001/d/finances` endpoint for document-specific operations, not just `http://localhost:4001/graphql`.

2.  **Inspect Network Requests:**
    *   Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and go to the "Network" tab.
    *   Perform an action in Powerhouse Connect that involves a document (e.g., creating, saving).
    *   Look for GraphQL requests. You'll often see operations like `pushUpdates`.
    *   Examine the "Request URL" or "Path" for these requests. You'll likely see they are being sent to a drive-specific endpoint (e.g., `/d/finances`, `/d/powerhouse`).
    *   The payload might show `operationName: "pushUpdates"`, confirming a document modification attempt.

3.  **Querying Drive Data:**
    *   If you want to query the state of documents within a specific drive via GraphQL, ensure you are targeting that drive's GraphQL endpoint (often `http://localhost:4001/d/<driveId>/graphql` or through specific queries available on the main supergraph that reference the drive). The exact query structure will depend on your document models.

4.  **Clear Caches and Reset (If Necessary):**
    *   Sometimes, old state or cached data can cause confusion. As a general troubleshooting step if issues persist:
        *   Try deleting the `.ph` folder in your user's home directory (`~/.ph`). This folder stores global Powerhouse configurations and cached dependencies. 
        *   Clear browser storage (localStorage, IndexedDB) for the Connect application.

## Expected Outcome
- You can correctly identify which GraphQL endpoint to use for different types of queries and operations.
- You understand that document-specific operations (like creating or updating documents in a drive) are typically handled by drive-specific endpoints.
- You can use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and confirm which endpoints Powerhouse Connect is using.
- Documents sync as expected, and you can retrieve their state by querying the appropriate endpoint.

## Common Issues and Solutions
-   **Issue:** Documents created in Connect don't appear when querying `http://localhost:4001/graphql`.
    -   **Solution:** You are likely querying the general supergraph. For document-specific data, ensure you are targeting the drive's endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:4001/d/<driveId>`) or using queries designed to fetch data from specific drives. Inspect Connect's network activity to see the endpoint it uses for `pushUpdates`.
-   **Issue:** Persistent syncing problems or unexpected behavior after trying the above.
    -   **Solution:** Consider cleaning the global Powerhouse setup by removing `~/.ph`
