# Release Changelog

## üöÄ **v3.3.0** (PRE-RELEASE)

- Significant `PHDocument` refactor.
  - Consolidating header information into the `header` field of the document. See the [PHDocument spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/index.md#header).
  - Introducing signed and unsigned documents. See the [PHDocument signing spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/signing.md).

### Migration Guide

- `PHDocument` changes:
  - **This version requires that document models be regenerated**. This means that you will need to run `ph generate` to regenerate the `gen` folder for document models.
  - `id` and `slug` have been moved from global state to the `header` field of the document. Thus, `document.state.global.id` is now `document.header.id`.


## üöÄ **v3.2.0**



## üöÄ **v3.1.0**

This release brings improvements to the **Cloud Environment Setup Flow,** a Connect build, updated PH commands

### `Ph service setup` command

- We have a simplified and optimized script to guide a builder through the setup of his cloud environment with connect & switchboard services.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Try to run the `ph service setup` flow on a cloud instance on AWS or digital ocean and install a @powerhousedao/todo-demo-package.

## üöÄ **v1.0.22 ‚áí v1.1.0**

[https://connect.phd/](https://staging.connect.phd/)

This release brings improvements that make it easier to **work with the Powerhouse CLI, understand available commands, and develop with greater confidence.**

‚ú® **Highlights**

### **Better CLI Documentation & Help**

- You‚Äôll notice clearer help messages when you run `ph help` or `ph {command} --help` (e.g. `ph init --help`). We‚Äôve redesigned the help output to be **more readable and useful right from your terminal.**
- Running `ph --version` now shows **additional context about your CLI installation** to help debug or verify your setup.

üëâ **View the latest commands documentation here: [COMMANDS.md on GitHub](./clis/ph-cli/COMMANDS.md) 
(Soon on academy too)** 

‚úÖ **What to try:** Run `ph help` or `ph init --help` and see the improved help output. Check out the online docs if you prefer reading in markdown!

---

### **Improved Project Initialization & Dependency Management**

- `ph init`, `ph setup-globals`, `ph update`, and `ph use` have **improved error handling and clearer messages** to guide you through project setup and environment switching.
- We‚Äôll continue making these commands more interactive with the help of the `interactive-commander` library soon.
- Dependency updates to latest versions of `vite`, `vitest`, `tailwindcss` and more keep your projects aligned with latest versions.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Run `ph update` in your project to pull in the latest compatible Powerhouse dependencies.

---

### **Improved Document Model Editing & Validation**

- We‚Äôve made the SDL parsing and schema validation **safer and more reliable**, reducing cryptic GraphQL errors in the editor, to make document model definition a bit more reliable.
- A drive editor refactor for `DriveEditorContainer` and `DriveExplorer` inside Drive Explorer nowsupport dynamic document model and editor module injection. Giving you a smoother custom drive editor experience.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Open a document in Studio mode and test schema edits or validation‚Äîerror handling should feel more predictable/not brick your document model. 

---

### **Cleaner Drive Deletion Across Storages**

- Removing a drive from your local storage, filesystem, or browser storage is now **more consistent and reliable.** You now have unified drive deletion behavior across `BrowserStorage`, `FilesystemStorage`, and `MemoryStorage` to ensure consistent data cleanup.
- You can now delete a drive and **immediately recreate a new one with the same ID and slug without issues.**

‚úÖ **What to try:** Delete a drive and re-add it with the same ID to confirm a clean reset.

### üêû **Bug Fixes**

- Resolved an issue where `ph add` didn‚Äôt properly clean up installed packages.
- Fixed missing type imports and inconsistencies in CLI command modules.
- Addressed redundant drive deletion logic across storage layers.
