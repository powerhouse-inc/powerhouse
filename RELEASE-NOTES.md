# Release Changelog

## üöÄ **v3.3.0** (PRE-RELEASE)

- Significant `PHDocument` refactor.
  - Consolidating header information into the `header` field of the document. See the [PHDocument spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/index.md#header).
  - Introducing signed and unsigned documents. See the [PHDocument signing spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/signing.md).
- Processor generator updates.
  - The analytics processor template now includes a namespace and batch inserts by default.
  - Analytics factories are now in their own files, allowing for multiple factories to be generated.

### Migration Guide

- `PHDocument` changes:
  - **This version requires that document models be regenerated**. This means that you will need to run `ph generate` to regenerate the `gen` folder for document models.
  - Document metadata fields (like `id`, `slug`, `documentType`, `created`, `lastModified`, etc) have been moved to a `header` field of the document. Thus, `document.id` is now `document.header.id`.
  - `created` and `lastModified` have been renamed to `createdAtUtcIso` and `lastModifiedUtcIso` respectively.
- Processor generator updates:
  - A root processor factory is now generated in the `processors` folder. This will aggregate the collection of all processor factories. It is highly recommended to use this root factory to register all processors. Generating a new processor will put this root factory in place.

## üöÄ **v3.2.0**

‚ú® **Highlights**

### **Drive Analytics System**

- Introducing an analytics system for drives and documents with dedicated processors for tracking operations, changes, and usage patterns.
- Analytics data is automatically collected and stored in dedicated tables, providing insights into document lifecycle and drive activity.
- New analytics query subscriptions enable real-time monitoring of the data in your drive.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Explore the new Drive Analytics documentation in the Academy to understand how analytics processors work and how to leverage analytics data in your applications. It currently happens though an initial analytics modal with the Sky-Atlas use case. This will later be adapted to the to-do list demo project.

### **Update of Front-end Architecture & Performance**

- Feature Preview: A new set of hooks were implemented to manage state on a more granular way and avoid unnecessary rerenders.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Initial documentation about the hooks can be found [here](https://github.com/powerhouse-inc/powerhouse/blob/main/packages/common/state/README.md)

**Feature preview:** The new hooks are not fully integrated into Connect yet, however, they can be used in custom drive editors by wrapping the editor component with the new provider:

```diff
+import { AtomStoreProvider } from "@powerhousedao/common";

export default function Editor(props: IProps) {
  return (
+    <AtomStoreProvider reactor={props.context.reactor}>
      <DriveContextProvider value={props.context}>
        <WagmiContext>
          <BaseEditor {...props} />
        </WagmiContext>
      </DriveContextProvider>
+    </AtomStoreProvider>
  );
}
```

### üêû **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed drag and drop functionality in the generic drive explorer
- Improved document storage with better id/slug resolution
- Enhanced build process with better Prisma handling and external package management
- Reduced unnecessary logging and improved subscription performance with debounced refetches
- Added safer validation for document properties to prevent runtime errors
- Reimplemented the Switchboard button to open the document model subgraph

### Updates for [www.staging.academy.powerhouse](https://staging.powerhouse.academy/)

- Update of the Get Started chapter
- Update of the Mastery Track - Document Creation Chapter

## üöÄ **v3.1.0**

This release brings improvements to the **Cloud Environment Setup Flow,** a Connect build, updated PH commands

### `Ph service setup` command

- We have a simplified and optimized script to guide a builder through the setup of his cloud environment with connect & switchboard services.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Try to run the `ph service setup` flow on a cloud instance on AWS or digital ocean and install a @powerhousedao/todo-demo-package.

[https://staging.powerhouse.academy/academy/MasteryTrack/Launch/SetupEnvironment](https://staging.powerhouse.academy/academy/MasteryTrack/Launch/SetupEnvironment)

### `ph connect build` command

- We have implemented `ph connect build` which bundles the connect app with the packages installed by the user in production mode.

## üöÄ **v1.0.22 ‚áí v1.1.0**

[https://connect.phd/](https://staging.connect.phd/)

This release brings improvements that make it easier to **work with the Powerhouse CLI, understand available commands, and develop with greater confidence.**

‚ú® **Highlights**

### **Better CLI Documentation & Help**

- You‚Äôll notice clearer help messages when you run `ph help` or `ph {command} --help` (e.g. `ph init --help`). We‚Äôve redesigned the help output to be **more readable and useful right from your terminal.**
- Running `ph --version` now shows **additional context about your CLI installation** to help debug or verify your setup.

üëâ **View the latest commands documentation here: [COMMANDS.md on GitHub](./clis/ph-cli/COMMANDS.md)
(Soon on academy too)**

‚úÖ **What to try:** Run `ph help` or `ph init --help` and see the improved help output. Check out the online docs if you prefer reading in markdown!

---

### **Improved Project Initialization & Dependency Management**

- `ph init`, `ph setup-globals`, `ph update`, and `ph use` have **improved error handling and clearer messages** to guide you through project setup and environment switching.
- We‚Äôll continue making these commands more interactive with the help of the `interactive-commander` library soon.
- Dependency updates to latest versions of `vite`, `vitest`, `tailwindcss` and more keep your projects aligned with latest versions.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Run `ph update` in your project to pull in the latest compatible Powerhouse dependencies.

---

### **Improved Document Model Editing & Validation**

- We‚Äôve made the SDL parsing and schema validation **safer and more reliable**, reducing cryptic GraphQL errors in the editor, to make document model definition a bit more reliable.
- A drive editor refactor for `DriveEditorContainer` and `DriveExplorer` inside Drive Explorer nowsupport dynamic document model and editor module injection. Giving you a smoother custom drive editor experience.

‚úÖ **What to try:** Open a document in Studio mode and test schema edits or validation‚Äîerror handling should feel more predictable/not brick your document model.

---

### **Cleaner Drive Deletion Across Storages**

- Removing a drive from your local storage, filesystem, or browser storage is now **more consistent and reliable.** You now have unified drive deletion behavior across `BrowserStorage`, `FilesystemStorage`, and `MemoryStorage` to ensure consistent data cleanup.
- You can now delete a drive and **immediately recreate a new one with the same ID and slug without issues.**

‚úÖ **What to try:** Delete a drive and re-add it with the same ID to confirm a clean reset.

### üêû **Bug Fixes**

- Resolved an issue where `ph add` didn‚Äôt properly clean up installed packages.
- Fixed missing type imports and inconsistencies in CLI command modules.
- Addressed redundant drive deletion logic across storage layers.

**Complete Changelog & published package version can be found here:**
