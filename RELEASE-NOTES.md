# Release Changelog

## üöÄ **(PRE-RELEASE)**

## BREAKING CHANGES

### `ProcessorFactory` signature change.

The `ProcessorFactory` now takes a `PHDocumentHeader` instead of a `driveId`.

**Before (v5.0):**

```typescript
export type ProcessorFactory = (
  driveId: string,
) => ProcessorRecord[] | Promise<ProcessorRecord[]>;
```

**After (v5.1):**

```typescript
export type ProcessorFactory = (
  driveHeader: PHDocumentHeader,
) => ProcessorRecord[] | Promise<ProcessorRecord[]>;
```

## Migration Steps

1. Update your processor factories to take a `PHDocumentHeader` instead of a `driveId`.
2. If necessary, regenerate your processor with `ph generate` to get the latest changes.

### Type parameters have been removed

The `Action` type parameters have been removed, `Operation` type parameters have been removed, and the last `PHDocument` type parameter has been removed.

**Before (v5.0):**

```typescript
const action: Action<MyDocModelActionType, unknown> = {
  type: "my-action",
  input: {
    name: "John Doe",
  },
};
```

**After (v5.1):**

```typescript
const action: Action<unknown> = {
  type: "my-action",
  input: {
    name: "John Doe",
  },
};
```

### `OperationScope` has been removed

Previously, an enum existed called `OperationScope` that was used to define the scope of an operation. This has been removed and replaced with a string type.

**Before (v5.0):**

```typescript
const operation: Operation = {
  scope: OperationScope.Global,
};
```

**After (v5.1):**

```typescript
const operation: Operation = {
  scope: "global",
};
```

### `PHBaseState` changes

The `PHBaseState` type has a number of changes:

- It no longer has a type parameter.
- `document` and `auth` scopes are now required.

### `Action` and `Operation` changes

The `Action` and `Operation` types have a number of changes:

- `Operation` no longer extends `Action`, it _has_ one.
- Some fields have been renamed or removed.

## Migration Steps

1. Update to the lastest `codegen` package.
2. Regenerate your document models.

## üöÄ **v5.0.0**

## BREAKING CHANGES

### **New Document Creation Pattern**

**Breaking Change**: Documents are no longer created using `ADD_FILE` operations. Instead, documents now exist independently and are created using the new `addDocument` method.

**Before (v4.x):**

```typescript
// Old pattern: Documents were created via ADD_FILE operations
await server.addDriveAction(driveId, {
  type: "ADD_FILE",
  input: {
    id: documentId,
    name: "My Document",
    documentType: "my-document-type",
    document: documentData,
    synchronizationUnits: [...]
  }
});
```

**After (v5.0):**

```typescript
// New pattern: Documents exist independently
await server.addDocument(document, meta);
// Then optionally add to drive if needed
await server.addAction(driveId, {
  type: "ADD_FILE",
  input: {
    id: documentId,
    name: "My Document",
    documentType: "my-document-type",
  },
});
```

**Key Changes:**

- **`addDocument`** - New method for creating documents
- `ADD_FILE` operation no longer takes the document state and synchronization units as input
- Documents can exist without being part of any drive
- Cleaner separation between document creation and drive organization

**Migration Steps:**

1. Update `ADD_FILE` operations and add `addDocument()` calls

### **IBaseDocumentDriveServer Interface Simplification**

The `IBaseDocumentDriveServer` interface has been simplified to remove the need for passing `driveId` parameters when interacting with documents. This change improves the API by removing redundant parameters and aligning with the new document-centric approach.

#### **Method Signature Changes**

The following methods have had their signatures simplified by removing the `driveId` parameter:

- `addOperation(driveId, documentId, operation, options)` ‚Üí `addOperation(documentId, operation, options)`
- `addOperations(driveId, documentId, operations, options)` ‚Üí `addOperations(documentId, operations, options)`
- `queueOperation(driveId, documentId, operation, options)` ‚Üí `queueOperation(documentId, operation, options)`
- `queueOperations(driveId, documentId, operations, options)` ‚Üí `queueOperations(documentId, operations, options)`
- `queueAction(driveId, documentId, action, options)` ‚Üí `queueAction(documentId, action, options)`
- `queueActions(driveId, documentId, actions, options)` ‚Üí `queueActions(documentId, actions, options)`
- `getDocument(driveId, documentId, options)` ‚Üí `getDocument(documentId, options)`
- `addAction(driveId, documentId, action, options)` ‚Üí `addAction(documentId, action, options)`
- `addActions(driveId, documentId, actions, options)` ‚Üí `addActions(documentId, actions, options)`

#### **Migration Guide**

**Before (v4.x):**

```typescript
// Old method signatures requiring driveId
await server.addOperation(driveId, documentId, operation, options);
await server.queueActions(driveId, documentId, actions, options);
await server.getDocument(driveId, documentId, options);
```

**After (v5.0):**

```typescript
// New simplified method signatures
await server.addOperation(documentId, operation, options);
await server.queueActions(documentId, actions, options);
await server.getDocument(documentId, options);
```

#### **Backward Compatibility**

**Legacy support is maintained** - the old method signatures with `driveId` parameters are still supported but marked as `@deprecated`. They will be removed in a future release.

When using the old signatures, you'll see deprecation warnings guiding you to the new method signatures. This allows for gradual migration without breaking existing code.

**Migration Steps:**

1. Update your code to use the new method signatures without `driveId`
2. Test your application to ensure all functionality works correctly
3. Remove any unused `driveId` variables from your codebase

#### **Deprecated Drive-Specific Methods**

The following drive-specific methods are also deprecated in favor of the standard document methods:

- `addDriveOperation` ‚Üí use `addOperation`
- `addDriveOperations` ‚Üí use `addOperations`
- `queueDriveOperation` ‚Üí use `queueOperation`
- `queueDriveOperations` ‚Üí use `queueOperations`
- `queueDriveAction` ‚Üí use `queueAction`
- `queueDriveActions` ‚Üí use `queueActions`
- `addDriveAction` ‚Üí use `addAction`
- `addDriveActions` ‚Üí use `addActions`

## üöÄ **v4.0.0**

## BREAKING CHANGES

‚ö†Ô∏è For both the Dspot team & BAI team pull requests have been created that support with the breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

BAI team:[Contributor Billing Pull Request](https://github.com/powerhouse-inc/contributor-billing/pull/3)
Dspot Team: [Effective-Octo-Adventure](https://github.com/powerhouse-inc/effective-octo-adventure/pull/162)

### **Significant `PHDocument` refactor**

- Consolidating header information into the `header` field of the document. See the [PHDocument spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/index.md#header).
- Introducing signed and unsigned documents with Ed25519 keys . See the [PHDocument signing spec](./packages/reactor/docs/planning/PHDocument/signing.md).

### **Processor generator updates**

- The analytics processor template now includes a namespace and batch inserts by default.
- Analytics factories are now in their own files, allowing for multiple factories to be generated.

### Additional Migration Guide has been create to help you navigate the breaking change of other packages

- `PHDocument` changes:
  - **This version requires that document models be regenerated**. This means that you will need to run `ph generate` to regenerate the `gen` folder for document models.
  - Document metadata fields (like `id`, `slug`, `documentType`, `created`, `lastModified`, etc) have been moved to a `header` field of the document. Thus, `document.id` is now `document.header.id`.
  - `created` and `lastModified` have been renamed to `createdAtUtcIso` and `lastModifiedUtcIso` respectively.
- Processor generator updates:
  - A root processor factory is now generated in the `processors` folder. This will aggregate the collection of all processor factories. It is highly recommended to use this root factory to register all processors. Generating a new processor will put this root factory in place.

‚ú® **Highlights of this release**

New features for managing, querying, and analyzing information in real-time.
This release focuses on improving data accessibility, enhancing performance, and providing a foundation for advanced analytical insights.

Introducing the **Relational Database & Operational Processor System**, a new architecture designed to enhance data handling, querying, and synchronization across the host-apps.

### 2. Relational Database & Operational Processor System

**New Operational Processor Architecture with Namespacing**: This introduces a flexible and scalable way to process document operations and transform them into a relational database format. Namespacing ensures conflict avoidance and better organization of data.
**Database Schema Generation and Migration Support**: The system now automatically generates database schemas and supports migrations, simplifying database management and ensuring data consistency. It leverages Kysely for type-safe query construction.
**Enhanced Analytics Capabilities with Operational Queries**: By transforming document data into a relational store, we can now perform complex analytical queries that were previously challenging. This enables more robust reporting and data analysis.
**Processor Factory System and Root Processor Aggregation**: This provides a standardized way to create and manage different types of processors, including those for relational databases, and allows for efficient aggregation of processed data.

‚úÖ **What to try:**

- Experiment with generating a new operational database processor using the `ph generate` command and specify different document types to see how the schema and files are created.
- Define a custom database schema and implement an `onStrands` method in your processor to index document states into the relational store.
- Run tests for your new processor, leveraging the in-memory PGlite instance, to validate the stored state with database queries.
- Generate a GraphQL subgraph to expose your processed data, then try running various GraphQL queries to access and filter your transformed data.

### 3. Enhanced Analytics & Performance Monitoring

**Drive and Document Analytics Processors**: New processors are in place to specifically handle and prepare data for analytics related to drives and documents, enabling targeted performance monitoring and insights.
**Real-Time Relational Query**: Leveraging PGlite's live query feature, the system now supports real-time queries. This means that as underlying data changes, the results of these queries are updated instantly without requiring a refresh.
**Performance Improvements in Connect Apps**: The integration of the new operational database and live query capabilities directly within the Connect UI significantly improves the performance of data retrieval and display, offering a more responsive user experience for applications built on Connect.

‚úÖ **What to try:**

- Observe the real-time data synchronization by making changes to documents in Connect and simultaneously viewing the updates through a GraphQL interface.
- Implement search functionality within your Connect UI using the `createProcessorQuery` hook to leverage the new database schema for type-safe queries.
- Create or modify documents in Connect and watch how the changes are immediately reflected in your Connect application's display, demonstrating the live query feature.
- Explore building more complex analytical queries that span multiple documents, taking advantage of the relational store's capabilities.

**Feature preview:** The new hooks are not fully integrated into Connect yet, however, they can be used in custom drive editors by wrapping the editor component with the new provider:

```diff
+import { AtomStoreProvider } from "@powerhousedao/common";

export default function Editor(props: IProps) {
  return (
+    <AtomStoreProvider reactor={props.context.reactor}>
      <DriveContextProvider value={props.context}>
        <WagmiContext>
          <BaseEditor {...props} />
        </WagmiContext>
      </DriveContextProvider>
+    </AtomStoreProvider>
  );
}
```
