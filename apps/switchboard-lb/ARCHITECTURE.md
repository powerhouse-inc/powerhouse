# switchboard-lb — Architecture

This document is the design spec. `CLAUDE.md` covers _how we work_; this covers _what we're building and why_.

**Implementation target: OpenResty** (nginx + Lua). See §2 for why.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

1. **Correctness first**: a given document is always routed to the same `switchboard` instance for the lifetime of that pinning. No split-brain writes.
2. **Payload-aware routing**: inspect GraphQL requests deeply enough to find the document being touched, cheaply.
3. **Low, predictable tail latency**: LB-added latency in the low hundreds of microseconds.
4. **Operable**: structured logs, Prometheus metrics, graceful reload of the backend list without dropping connections.
5. **Small, well-understood surface area**: we'd rather run a stock binary with a few hundred lines of config than maintain a bespoke network daemon.

### Non-goals (initially)

- TLS termination. Assume a TLS-terminating edge (ALB / cloud LB / another nginx) in front. Revisit once the core is solid.
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to the client. HTTP/1.1 only in the MVP. (nginx supports h2 trivially; we just don't enable it yet.)
- Authn/authz. We forward headers untouched; `switchboard` remains the policy decision point.
- Rate limiting, WAF, caching. Out of scope, even though nginx could do them.
- Dynamic service discovery (Consul / Kubernetes API). Backends come from a config file; reload on `SIGHUP` / `nginx -s reload`.
- Rebalancing existing documents across backends. Pinning is sticky once established.

## 2. Why OpenResty (and not X)

We evaluated four implementation strategies:

| Approach                    | Verdict                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Custom C daemon             | Rejected for MVP. Large surface area, long timeline, and the interesting problems (pinning invariant, migration story) are independent of language. Revisit only if we outgrow OpenResty.       |
| Plain nginx                 | Rejected. `hash $var consistent` can hash on URL params or headers, but cannot read a JSON request body. The path-scoped route would work; the `POST /graphql` route would not.                 |
| HAProxy + Lua               | Viable. `http-buffer-request` + a Lua converter can set a variable, then `balance hash <var> consistent` routes. Slightly less mature Lua ecosystem than OpenResty for this specific shape.     |
| **OpenResty (nginx + Lua)** | **Chosen.** First-class body access via `ngx.req.read_body()`, mature `cjson`, native `hash $var consistent` in the upstream block, rich `lua-resty-*` ecosystem for health checks and metrics. |

What OpenResty buys us concretely:

- **nginx** handles accept loop, HTTP parsing, keep-alive, upstream pooling, graceful reload, worker supervision.
- **`rewrite_by_lua` / `access_by_lua`** is the exact phase we need to inspect the body and set a routing variable _before_ the upstream is chosen.
- **`hash $doc_id consistent`** in the upstream block does rendezvous-style consistent hashing natively.
- **`ngx.timer.every` + cosocket + `lua_shared_dict`** are enough to run our own active probe loop without taking the off-the-shelf `lua-resty-upstream-healthcheck` library — see §5.2 for why pinning forced custom probing.
- **`nginx-lua-prometheus`** gives us Prometheus-format metrics without a sidecar.

The tradeoff we accept: Lua on the hot path. For GQL-sized payloads (sub-MB), `cjson.decode` is a few tens of microseconds — dominated by the network round trip. We gate this assumption with load tests (see §8 M0).

## 3. System context

```
┌─────────┐     HTTP       ┌───────────────┐    HTTP    ┌───────────────┐
│ clients │ ──────────────▶│ switchboard-  │ ─────────▶ │ switchboard #1│
└─────────┘                │     lb        │            └───────────────┘
                           │  (OpenResty)  │            ┌───────────────┐
                           │               │ ─────────▶ │ switchboard #2│

                           │               │            ┌───────────────┐
                           │               │ ─────────▶ │ switchboard #N│
                           └───────────────┘            └───────────────┘
```

Each `switchboard` instance:

- Runs an independent Reactor.
- Owns a subset of documents (the ones pinned to it).
- Exposes GraphQL at `/graphql` (global) and `/d/:drive/graphql` (per-drive).
- Is otherwise identical to its siblings.

The LB is the only component that knows the pinning map.

## 4. Request lifecycle (mapped to nginx phases)

```
accept ─▶ parse headers ─▶ rewrite_by_lua: classify + extract doc id
                                │
                                ▼
                        $doc_id set ─▶ upstream { hash $doc_id consistent }
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                       proxy_pass ─▶ upstream conn pool
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                         stream response back to client
```

The Lua block runs in the nginx **rewrite phase** — after headers are parsed, before the upstream is chosen. It sets `ngx.var.doc_id`, which the `hash` directive reads when picking a backend.

### 4.1 Route classes

| Class                          | Example                                                                                                             | Where `$doc_id` comes from                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Subgraph (document-scoped)** | `POST /graphql`, `POST /graphql/r`, `POST /graphql/<model>`, `POST /graphql/stream`, `POST /graphql/<model>/stream` | Lua reads body, parses JSON, pulls the owning identifier from `variables`. Key set documented in §4.3. |
| **Drive metadata**             | `GET /d/:drive`                                                                                                     | REST; returns the same payload from any backend. Routed to any healthy backend.                        |
| **Global**                     | `GET /health`, introspection queries                                                                                | handled by the LB directly or routed to any backend.                                                   |
| **Subscription**               | `WS /graphql/subscriptions`                                                                                         | upgrade forwarded to the pool; sticky for the connection's lifetime.                                   |

Every document-touching request pays a body read + JSON decode. There is no path-only fast path — the real switchboard GraphQL surface (see `packages/reactor-api/src/graphql/reactor/subgraph.ts` and `document-model-subgraph.ts`) never encodes the owning document in the URL. The body-parse cost dominates the LB's per-request overhead; see §2 for the tradeoff we accepted in picking OpenResty.

**Method and shape contract on `/graphql`:** the LB is POST-only with a single JSON object body. GET requests, query-string queries, GraphQL request batching (`[{query, variables}, ...]`), persisted-query-only requests with no `variables`, and any request whose body fails to JSON-decode all return 400. This is by design — every supported routing key lives in `variables`, so anything else is unrouteable. If a real client need for GET / batching / APQ-only ever appears, see §9 Q10.

### 4.2 Concrete config sketch

The upstream block below is shown for production hostnames and switchboard's default port (`4001`, see `apps/switchboard/src/server.mts`). The committed `conf/upstreams.conf` instead points at the dev compose stubs (`sb-1:8080` / `sb-2:8080` / `sb-3:8080`) — same shape, different `server` lines. Production swaps the `server` entries; nothing else moves.

```nginx
# upstreams.conf
upstream switchboards {
    hash $doc_id consistent;
    # max_fails=0 disables passive mark-down so the hash module never
    # skips a peer at selection time — see §5.2 "Pinning under failure".
    server sb-1.internal:4001 max_fails=0;
    server sb-2.internal:4001 max_fails=0;
    server sb-3.internal:4001 max_fails=0;
    keepalive 64;
}

# routes.conf
server {
    listen 8080;
    client_max_body_size 256k;

    # Subscriptions: WebSocket upgrade. Exact match so it wins over
    # the /graphql prefix below.
    location = /graphql/subscriptions {
        proxy_pass http://switchboards;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 1h;
        proxy_send_timeout 1h;
        proxy_next_upstream off;
    }

    # Document-scoped: supergraph, reactor subgraph, and every
    # document-model subgraph all share this prefix. Owning id
    # comes from the JSON body.
    location /graphql {
        rewrite_by_lua_block { require("route").from_body() }
        proxy_pass http://switchboards;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_next_upstream off;
    }

    # Drive metadata (REST). Safe to any healthy backend.
    location ~ ^/d/[^/]+$ {
        proxy_pass http://switchboards;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_next_upstream off;
    }

    # Global health check, handled locally.
    location = /health {
        access_log off;
        return 200 "ok\n";
    }

    # /metrics served on a separate listener (see §6.4).
}
```

```lua
-- lua/route.lua — illustrative single-identifier path only.
-- Multi-identifier and nested-path cases are deferred to §9 Q7/Q8.
local cjson = require("cjson.safe")

local M = {}

-- Top-level identifier keys across ReactorSubgraph and DocumentModelSubgraph.
-- See §4.3 for the full set and which operations use each.
local ID_KEYS = {
  "identifier",          -- document, deleteDocument, doc-model queries
  "documentIdentifier",  -- mutateDocument{,Async}, renameDocument
  "parentIdentifier",    -- addChildren, removeChildren, createDocument
  "childIdentifier",     -- documentParents
  "docId",               -- every per-operation mutation on document models
}

function M.from_body()
  ngx.req.read_body()
  local body = ngx.req.get_body_data()
  if not body then return require("errors").bad_request("empty body") end

  local payload = cjson.decode(body)
  if type(payload) ~= "table" or type(payload.variables) ~= "table" then
    return require("errors").bad_request("missing or malformed variables")
  end

  for _, k in ipairs(ID_KEYS) do
    local v = payload.variables[k]
    if type(v) == "string" and #v > 0 then
      ngx.var.doc_id = v
      return
    end
  end

  return require("errors").conflict("no identifier in variables")
end

return M
```

This sketch shows the single-top-level-key shape only. The shipped `lua/route.lua` (M2) also walks nested paths (`filter.documentId`, `input.filter.documentId`), rejects multi-identifier batches (`identifiers[]`, cross-parent `moveChildren`, cross-channel `pushSyncEnvelopes`, multi-element `touchChannel`) with 409, and routes `pushSyncEnvelopes` on `envelopes[0].channelMeta.id`. See §4.3 for the key set and the precedence rule, §4.4 for multi-document policy, and §9 Q7/Q8 for rationale. The shipped module is the authority — when the spec and the code diverge, fix one or the other and note the decision here. Every module in `lua/` still fits on one screen.

### 4.3 Body inspection rules

1. Cap the body via `client_max_body_size 256k` in the server block. Oversize bodies get `413` before Lua runs.
2. `ngx.req.read_body()` buffers the body into memory. **`client_body_buffer_size` must equal `client_max_body_size`** (both `256k` today). If `client_body_buffer_size` is smaller, nginx silently spools the body to a temp file and `ngx.req.get_body_data()` returns nil — the Lua extractor then 400s every request with "empty body". Keep them in lockstep on every config change.
3. Parse with `cjson.safe` — never the raising variant.
4. Look for the owning identifier in `variables`. The documented key set, derived from the real subgraph resolvers:

   | Key                                                | Operations                                                                                                                         |
   | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `identifier`                                       | `document`, `deleteDocument`, all `<Model>.document` queries                                                                       |
   | `identifiers` _(array)_                            | `deleteDocuments` — see §4.4                                                                                                       |
   | `documentIdentifier`                               | `mutateDocument`, `mutateDocumentAsync`, `renameDocument`                                                                          |
   | `parentIdentifier`                                 | `createDocument(parentIdentifier?)`, `createEmptyDocument(parentIdentifier?)`, `addChildren`, `removeChildren`, `documentChildren` |
   | `childIdentifier`                                  | `documentParents`                                                                                                                  |
   | `sourceParentIdentifier`, `targetParentIdentifier` | `moveChildren` — both present — see §4.4                                                                                           |
   | `docId`                                            | every per-operation mutation generated for a document model (sync + async)                                                         |
   | `filter.documentId` (nested)                       | `documentOperations` query                                                                                                         |
   | `input.filter.documentId` (nested, list variant)   | `touchChannel`                                                                                                                     |
   | `envelopes[0].channelMeta.id` (nested)             | `pushSyncEnvelopes` — route on this; supersedes the old operations-walk. See §4.4 and §9 Q7.                                       |

5. **Precedence (top-level keys).** The five top-level identifier keys (`identifier`, `documentIdentifier`, `parentIdentifier`, `childIdentifier`, `docId`) are scanned **in that order**; the first non-empty string match wins and the rest are ignored. The current schema never produces a request with two of these keys set at once, so this rule is academic — but it's pinned here so it doesn't drift. The dedicated handlers for `envelopes` (pushSyncEnvelopes), `identifiers[]` (deleteDocuments), and `sourceParentIdentifier` / `targetParentIdentifier` (moveChildren) run **before** the top-level scan. If a future schema legitimately co-mingles top-level keys, switch to a 409-on-conflict policy here rather than silently picking one.
6. If no identifier is found after all the rules in §4.3 step 5 and §4.4, return `409` with a message pointing at the documented key set. We **do not guess**.

We explicitly do **not** run a GraphQL operation parser. The contract with clients is: the owning identifier appears in one of the documented `variables` keys above. We publish and version that contract.

### 4.4 Multi-document requests

Several real mutations carry more than one document identifier. MVP policy is **reject with 409** whenever the correct single backend cannot be determined. Forwarding multi-id requests to any healthy backend is never acceptable — it silently violates the pinning invariant.

- `deleteDocuments` — `variables.identifiers[]` array present → 409.
- `moveChildren` — both parents present and equal → route on that value; both present and different → 409.
- `pushSyncEnvelopes` — route on `envelopes[0].channelMeta.id`; envelopes spanning multiple channels → 409.
- `touchChannel` — `variables.input.filter.documentId` single element → route; list > 1 → 409.
- Any request with no identifier after all rules run → 409.

See §9 Q7 for rationale and the historical options that were ruled out.

### 4.5 Failure modes

- **Upstream refuses connection** → `proxy_pass` fails at TCP. We set `proxy_next_upstream off` (no retry across backends) **and** `max_fails=0` per `server` entry (no passive mark-down — see §5.2 for why). The request surfaces as `503` (translation note below); pinning is preserved — subsequent requests for the same doc keep targeting the same dead backend until it recovers.
- **Upstream times out mid-request** → same rule: no retry, `503` to the client.
- **Upstream returns 5xx** → pass through unchanged. The backend made a decision; the LB doesn't second-guess it.
- **Backend marked unhealthy by active checks** → reported on `/__hc/status` for observability. **No effect on peer selection**: the peer stays in the consistent-hash ring so pinned docs continue to fail closed (`503` via the TCP-refused path above) rather than silently re-routing to another backend. See §5.2.

**Status translation.** All of "no live upstream", "connection refused", and "upstream timed out" surface to clients as `503` via `proxy_intercept_errors on; error_page 502 504 = @no_backend;` in `routes.conf`. nginx's raw distinctions (`502` for connect failure / no live upstream, `504` for read timeout) are preserved in access logs via `$upstream_status`, but the wire response is uniformly `503` because the LB's contract is "this document is currently unavailable, retry later" — the cause distinction is for operators reading logs, not clients deciding retry policy. The over-translation is intentional; revisit only if a real client need to differentiate appears.

## 5. Pinning and routing

This is the heart of the system. Getting it wrong means data corruption.

### 5.1 Invariant

> For a given document id `D`, all successful mutations land on the same backend `B(D)` for as long as `D` exists. Reads **may** go anywhere, but in the MVP we route reads with the same function for simplicity and cache affinity.

### 5.2 Mechanism

nginx's `hash $var consistent` implements [Ketama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing)-style consistent hashing across the `server` entries in the upstream block. Weight of each server is configurable. Adding or removing a server remaps ~1/N of keys — the same fundamental tradeoff any stateless scheme has.

**Pinning under failure.** Standard nginx behavior is to skip peers marked `down` — whether by passive `max_fails` tracking or by an active healthcheck calling `set_peer_down` — and pick the next slot in the ring. That's catastrophic under §5.1's invariant: a doc pinned to a dead backend would silently re-route to a different one and split-brain its write log. We disable both paths. `upstreams.conf` sets `max_fails=0` so passive checks never mark peers down. `lua/healthcheck.lua` runs its own probe loop, tracking state in `lua_shared_dict healthcheck` for `/__hc/status` to read; it never calls `set_peer_down`. Net effect: peers always look "up" to the upstream module, the hash module always picks the originally-hashed peer, and a dead pin fails at TCP → 502 → §4.5's `@no_backend` → 503. The healthcheck's job is observability, not routing.

### 5.3 Caching

The consistent hash is cheap enough that we don't need a cache for correctness. We **may** add a per-worker `lua-resty-lrucache` keyed by `doc_id` as an optimization once we have numbers, but the MVP ships without it. If we add one, it must be invalidated on config reload.

### 5.4 Alternative: external directory (deferred)

Long-term we probably want an explicit `doc_id → backend` directory (Redis or Postgres) so that adding a backend doesn't remap a fraction of documents. This requires coordinated migration support in `switchboard`, which doesn't exist yet. Until it does, the MVP's "backend list is effectively immutable in prod" rule stands (see §6.3).

## 6. Configuration & operations

### 6.1 Config files

Everything lives under `conf/` and is mounted into the container. The layout is in `CLAUDE.md` §"Repo layout". Backends are defined in `upstreams.conf` as `server` entries in the `switchboards` upstream.

Runtime knobs like `client_max_body_size`, keepalive counts, and health-check intervals are in those files too — we don't introduce a parallel config format.

### 6.2 Reload semantics

`nginx -s reload`:

1. Master parses the new config. If it fails, the old workers keep running.
2. On success, master starts new workers with the new config.
3. Old workers finish their in-flight requests and exit.
4. Zero dropped connections.

This is a well-understood operation; we don't need to reinvent it. `scripts/reload.sh` wraps `nginx -t` (validate) → `nginx -s reload` (apply) and fails loudly if the test step fails.

### 6.3 Adding / removing backends

- **Adding**: `hash $doc_id consistent` remaps ~1/N of documents. Until `switchboard` supports migration, this is a coordinated maintenance event, not a self-serve operation.
- **Removing**: documents pinned to the removed server become unroutable. Same rule.

This is the biggest operational sharp edge of the MVP. Called out here and in `CLAUDE.md` so we don't forget.

### 6.4 Observability

- **Metrics** (Prometheus, via `nginx-lua-prometheus`, served on a separate internal listener like `:9090/metrics`):
  - `lb_requests_total{class,backend,status}`
  - `lb_request_duration_seconds{class,backend}` (histogram)
  - `lb_upstream_errors_total{backend,kind}`
  - `lb_body_parse_errors_total{reason}`
  - standard nginx stubs via `stub_status`
- **Logs**: custom `log_format` in `log_format.conf` emitting key=value. Include `request_id`, `remote_addr`, `doc_id` (when extracted), `upstream_addr`, `status`, `request_time`, `upstream_response_time`.
- **Traces**: out of scope for the MVP. Slot reserved for OpenTelemetry (`opentelemetry-nginx` module) later.
- **`X-LB-Upstream` response header** on `/graphql` and `/d/:drive` responses, exposing `$upstream_addr`. Dev-only debug aid for the `lb-loadtest` harness (§8 M4) — lets a test process observe per-request which backend served the response without log scraping. Not a production feature; the LB is dev-only-published anyway and the header is harmless if it leaks.

## 7. Concurrency model

nginx decides this for us, and that's part of the appeal:

- **`worker_processes auto;`** — one worker per core.
- **`SO_REUSEPORT`** via `listen ... reuseport;` so the kernel balances accepts.
- **Lua state is per-worker.** Shared state across workers (e.g., the healthcheck's view of upstream health) uses `lua_shared_dict`.
- **No thread pool, no work stealing.** Each request is handled end-to-end on the worker that accepted it.

We do not write our own event loop; we do not manage our own thread pool. This is a feature.

## 8. Milestones

Thin vertical slices, each end-to-end runnable.

- **M0 — Skeleton.** _Done._ `Dockerfile` (dev + runtime), `docker-compose.yml` with LB + 3 stub upstreams, `nginx.conf` serving `/health`, `busted` wired up, k6 baseline measuring nginx-alone overhead — see `test/integration/BASELINE.md` for the reference numbers we regression-check against.
- **M1 — Proxy plumbing.** _Done._ `POST /graphql` / `POST /graphql/*` / `GET /d/:drive` / `WS /graphql/subscriptions` proxied to the pool, `/health` served locally, `proxy_next_upstream off` throughout. `m1.sh` asserts path preservation, `X-Request-Id` passthrough, and that the WS upgrade reaches the pool.
- **M2 — Body-based routing.** _Done._ `lua/route.lua` reads the body, extracts the owning identifier per §4.3 / §4.4, and sets `$doc_id`; `upstreams.conf` is on `hash $doc_id consistent`. Multi-identifier operations 409 per §4.4; `pushSyncEnvelopes` routes on `envelopes[0].channelMeta.id`. `m2.sh` covers pinning, every 409/400/413 branch, and the no-Lua-on-non-`/graphql` invariant. The three-stage rollout (docs → Lua-but-`least_conn` → consistent-hash flip) all landed.
- **M3 — Health checks + reload-survival.** _Done._ Active probing for observability + a pinning-preserving 503 on dead backends per §4.5, plus integration coverage of WS reload-survival per §9 Q3. Concretely:
  - `lua_shared_dict healthcheck 1m;` and `init_worker_by_lua_block { require("healthcheck").run() }` in `nginx.conf` — shared state across workers per §7.
  - `lua/healthcheck.lua` runs a per-worker cosocket probe loop against every peer in the `switchboards` upstream every 2s (timeout 1s, fall=3, rise=2) hitting `GET /health`. State (`up`/`down`) is written to `lua_shared_dict healthcheck`; the loop **does not** call `set_peer_down` — see §5.2 for the pinning rationale. Switchboard's `/health` is liveness-only (registered before auth middleware in `packages/reactor-api/src/server.ts:379`); a true `/readyz` that 503s during init/drain is a switchboard-side follow-up.
  - `upstreams.conf` sets `max_fails=0` per server to disable nginx's passive mark-down. Combined with the healthcheck not calling `set_peer_down`, this is the load-bearing piece of "pinning under failure": the hash module always picks the same peer for a given `$doc_id`, even when that peer is dead — see §5.2.
  - `routes.conf` translates the resulting 502/504 (TCP refused, upstream timeout) into 503 via `proxy_intercept_errors on; error_page 502 504 = @no_backend;`. Underlying nginx status survives in access logs as `$upstream_status`. See §4.5.
  - `proxy_next_upstream off` stays — even before status translation, no backend swap is attempted on a transport error.
  - `/__hc/status` (localhost-only) renders peer state from the `lua_shared_dict`. `m3.sh` resolves docker-compose service names → IPs via `docker inspect` (peers in the status page are reported by `IP:port` — that's what `ngx.upstream.get_primary_peers` returns) and polls for transitions instead of time-waiting. Will move to the M4 metrics listener.
  - `m3.sh` covers eject, other-pin-survival, recovery, and the strict-pinning property: 5/5 requests pinned to a stopped backend get 503, never 200 from a different one. `m3_ws_reload.sh` (Q3) opens a real WS via `websocat` (added to the dev Dockerfile alongside `curl`), reloads nginx mid-flight, and asserts both the connection and frame round-trip survive.
  - Stubs in `test/fixtures/` now speak real WebSocket via `lua-resty-websocket-server`; `m1.sh`'s upgrade-check was updated from `200` to `101` accordingly.
- **M4 — Observability.** _Done._ Prometheus metrics + dedicated `:9090` observability listener, plus the `/__hc/status` move from M3. Concretely:
  - `nginx-lua-prometheus` 0.20240525 fetched as three pure-Lua files into `/usr/local/openresty/site/lualib/` from the dev + runtime Dockerfile stages. We deliberately avoid `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/lua/` because the dev compose mounts `./lua` there read-only, masking image-baked files. The `-alpine-fat` base is _not_ used — it does not bundle this library either, so its +400MB buys nothing.
  - `lua_shared_dict prometheus_metrics 2m;` in `nginx.conf`. `init_worker_by_lua_block` runs `metrics.run()` alongside `healthcheck.run()`. A parallel `map "" $route_class { default ""; }` declares the variable at http scope so the server-level `log_by_lua_block` can read it unconditionally.
  - `lua/metrics.lua` registers the §6.4 trio with the bucket boundaries `{0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1}` (M0 baseline 84µs median / 172µs p95 — default Prometheus buckets are useless at this scale). The `reason` label on `lb_body_parse_errors_total` is a bounded enum mapped from the human strings in `route.lua`'s call sites; the malformed-JSON case prefix-matches because cjson interpolates its decode error into the message. Unmapped reasons fall through to `"unknown"` with an `ngx.log(ngx.WARN, ...)` — bug signal, not a label explosion.
  - Each `location` block in `routes.conf` sets `$route_class` to `graphql|drive|health|subscription`. A single server-level `log_by_lua_block { require("metrics").record_request() }` covers every location including the `@no_backend` internal redirect (which reuses the original request's log phase — no double counting). Subscription duration observation is skipped (WS lifetime against a 1s-top histogram would dump every connection in `+Inf`); request count is still recorded.
  - `lua/errors.lua`'s `send()` calls `metrics.inc_parse_error(msg)` immediately before `ngx.exit(code)`, surfacing every 400/409 as a `lb_body_parse_errors_total` increment.
  - `conf/metrics.conf` defines a `listen 9090` server with `/metrics` and `/__hc/status`. The listener is reachable from the LB container's docker network only — nothing is published to the host in `docker-compose.yml`, so it's accessible from sibling compose services (e.g. the optional `prometheus` profile below) and via `docker exec <lb> curl 127.0.0.1:9090/...`, but never from off-host. `/__hc/status` moved here from `:8080` (M3 placeholder); `m3.sh` updated to scrape via `:9090`.
  - `m4.sh` covers: `/metrics` 200 on `:9090` and 404 on `:8080`, label combinations after a representative traffic mix, no `reason="unknown"` (which would mean an unmapped error string in `route.lua`), `/__hc/status` move. `metrics_spec.lua` is the cardinality unit test — one `it()` per `REASON_MAP` entry plus the malformed-JSON prefix match plus the unknown fallback, mocking `package.loaded["prometheus"]` so it runs without a live container.
  - **Optional local visualisation.** `docker-compose.yml` carries an opt-in `--profile observability` that brings up `prom/prometheus:v2.55.0` (scraping `lb:9090` every 5s) and `grafana/grafana:11.3.0` (anonymous Admin, no login wall) with a file-provisioned starter dashboard at `observability/grafana/dashboards/switchboard-lb.json` covering the §6.4 trio plus a backend-distribution panel for visually validating consistent-hash pinning. Launch with `docker compose --profile observability up -d`, then open Grafana at `http://127.0.0.1:3001` and (optionally) Prometheus at `http://127.0.0.1:9091`. No persistence — provisioning YAML/JSON is the source of truth; restarts re-render the same dashboard.
  - **Real-backend harness (developer aid).** `docker-compose.real.yml` is an override that swaps the three `sb-N` openresty stubs for real switchboard containers (`docker/Dockerfile --target switchboard`, PGlite storage in per-instance named volumes, no postgres dependency). Bring up with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.real.yml up -d --build`, then in another terminal run `pnpm --filter @powerhousedao/lb-loadtest verify`. The harness drives K synthetic document keys × M probe requests through the LB (defaults 20 × 10), reads `X-LB-Upstream` per response, and asserts (a) every key pins to exactly one backend, (b) keys distribute across multiple backends. Distinct from the `m1`/`m2`/`m3`/`m4` integration suites (which test the LB against canned stubs) — this harness verifies §5.1 end-to-end against the real switchboard image. M1–M4 tests still pass against stubs unchanged because they don't load the override. **Out of scope for v1:** full document-state round-trip consistency. The published `@powerhousedao/switchboard@latest` image baked into the switchboard Dockerfile target lags the in-repo schema and does not export `mutateDocument` / `createEmptyDocument` / `document(identifier:)`, so end-to-end document writes fail at the switchboard's GraphQL layer, not at the LB. The §5.1 invariant we care about is observable purely from the response header; consistency belongs in a follow-up after the image catches up.
  - Trace export remains out of scope (slot reserved for OpenTelemetry post-M5). `lb_upstream_errors_total` and `stub_status` from §6.4's longer list are deferred — no operational signal that warrants them yet.
- **M5 — Production hardening.** _Open-ended._ Pick a fuzz approach for `lua/route.lua` — Lua-side property tests in `busted` over `extract()` are the path of least resistance, since `cjson.safe` already short-circuits malformed JSON; the interesting target is the post-decode walk. ASAN: requires building OpenResty with debug + ASAN flags or using the `openresty-debug` packaging — the stock alpine image is **not** ASAN-built, so this is a custom-image task, not a flag flip. Author `RUNBOOK.md` (reload procedure via `scripts/reload.sh`, the "backend list is immutable in prod" rule from §6.3, the §9 Q6 TLS-edge requirement, and pointer to §9 Q4 for the still-open document migration story).

After M5 we reassess: directory-based pinning (§5.4)? TLS termination moved into the LB (§9 Q6)? HTTP/2 upstream?

End-to-end this is **~2–3 weeks of calendar time**, not months.

## 9. Open questions

Unresolved. Decide before the relevant milestone and record the decision here.

1. **Do we need a `balancer_by_lua_block` instead of `hash $doc_id consistent`?**

   **Decided (2026-04-21):** use the native `hash $doc_id consistent` directive. The MVP routing function is a pure function of `$doc_id`, which the built-in directive handles in C with Ketama-style consistent hashing. `balancer_by_lua_block` is the right tool only when the routing decision depends on state the directive cannot express (external directory, per-request migration hint, load-aware override) — none of which are MVP requirements. Adopting Lua on the balancer phase would add per-request overhead on top of the M2 body parse, duplicate `server`-directive behavior, and enlarge what we have to reason about under reload.

   **M3 footnote (2026-04-27).** The directive's built-in mark-down/skip behavior — both passive (`max_fails`) and active (via libraries that call `set_peer_down`) — is the _opposite_ of what §5.1's pinning invariant wants: skipping a down peer silently re-routes a pinned doc. M3 considered switching to `balancer_by_lua_block` to enforce strict pinning explicitly, but it was unnecessary. Setting `max_fails=0` and writing the active healthcheck to track state in a `lua_shared_dict` without calling `set_peer_down` (see §5.2) keeps every peer "up" from nginx's view, so the directive's selection math always picks the originally-hashed peer. Dead pin → TCP refused → 503 via `@no_backend`. The decision above stands.

   **Revisit trigger:** introduction of an external pinning directory (§5.4), or a per-request decision that is not a pure function of `$doc_id`.

   **M1/M2 config reconciliation _(historical, both stages now landed)_.** The M1 commit ran `least_conn` so the upstream wasn't hashing on an unpopulated `$doc_id`; the M2 commit that introduced `lua/route.lua` flipped the upstream back to `hash $doc_id consistent` atomically, so there was never a window where the config hashed on an empty key. The `map "" $doc_id { default ""; }` block in `conf/nginx.conf` stays across every milestone — `conf/log_format.conf` references `$doc_id` directly, and nginx fails config parse with `unknown variable "$doc_id"` if the map is absent.

2. **Read vs write routing.** MVP routes both with the same function. Is there a case for fanning reads to any healthy backend? Only if reads tolerate stale data, and Reactor semantics suggest they don't. _Defer until after M5._
3. **Subscription stickiness across reloads.** A long-lived WS/SSE connection stays on the same worker's upstream connection across a reload because old workers drain gracefully. We need an integration test that actually proves this. _Owner: M3._
4. **How do operators migrate a document between backends?** Cross-cutting design touching `switchboard` and `reactor`. Until it exists, the backend list is immutable in prod. _Decide before we operate this at any meaningful scale._
5. **`POST /graphql` with no extractable doc id.**

   **Decided (2026-04-21):** reject with `409 Conflict`. The LB does not guess and does not forward to a default backend. If real traffic ever demands a broadcast escape hatch, that decision is revisited explicitly. Rule: fail loudly, never silently incorrect.

6. **Where does TLS terminate?** MVP assumes a TLS-terminating edge in front. If that's not available in a given deploy, we enable `listen 443 ssl;` in this LB.

   **Decided (2026-04-21, M1 scope):**
   - **Dev / CI:** plain HTTP on `:8080` (unchanged).
   - **Prod:** LB stays plain HTTP on `:8080` behind a separate TLS-terminating edge (cloud LB, ALB, or upstream nginx) that forwards plain HTTP to the LB's internal interface. This matches §1's non-goal and keeps the MVP out of cert-rotation / cipher-policy territory.
   - **In-LB TLS (`listen 443 ssl;`):** not built in M1. Add only when a specific deploy demands it — no speculative scaffolding.

   **Operational requirements this creates** (to be captured in a future `DEPLOY.md`; not a blocker for M1 code): the LB listener MUST NOT be exposed to the public internet directly; the TLS edge is responsible for `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which the LB will honor via `set_real_ip_from <edge CIDR>; real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;` once we add that config (deferrable to M3/M4).

   **Revisit trigger:** a specific deploy where no upstream TLS terminator is available, or a client that requires direct mTLS to the LB.

7. **Multi-identifier operations.**

   **Decided (2026-04-21):** MVP policy is reject-with-409 whenever the correct single backend cannot be determined.
   - `deleteDocuments(identifiers: [ID!]!)` — non-empty `variables.identifiers` array → 409. Split-and-fan-out deferred.
   - `moveChildren(sourceParentIdentifier, targetParentIdentifier, …)` — both parents present and equal → route on that value; both present and different → 409; only one present → route on it.
   - `pushSyncEnvelopes(envelopes: [...])` — reactor-to-reactor sync protocol. Route on `variables.envelopes[0].channelMeta.id`; if any envelope has a different `channelMeta.id`, return 409. Schema-verified 2026-04-21: `SyncEnvelopeInput.channelMeta: ChannelMetaInput!` and `ChannelMetaInput.id: String!` are both non-null (`packages/reactor-api/src/graphql/reactor/schema.graphql:325-332`), and every batch is produced by a single `GqlRequestChannel` stamping its own `channelId` on every envelope (`gql-req-channel.ts:785-843`) — all envelopes in one call share one `channelMeta.id` by construction.

   **Historical options considered** (none viable for MVP): (a) server-side split-and-merge — complex, deferred; (b) client pre-grouping — pushes complexity to every caller; (c) coordinator backend — hotspot; (d) federation-aware switchboard — no cross-Reactor coordinator exists today, so this option is impossible rather than undesirable.

8. **Nested identifier paths.**

   **Decided (2026-04-21):** hard-code the paths in `lua/route.lua` (option a). The schema shapes are stable internal protocol; generating from the schema (option b) adds build-time complexity; a client-supplied header (option c) pushes work to every caller.
   - `documentOperations` → `variables.filter.documentId` (string).
   - `touchChannel` → `variables.input.filter.documentId` (list). Accept single-element list; reject multi-element with 409.
   - `pushSyncEnvelopes` → `variables.envelopes[0].channelMeta.id`. This **supersedes** the nested `envelopes[].operations[].context.documentId` path listed in §4.3; `channelMeta.id` is the first-class routing key — always present, same for every envelope in a push.

   **Historical options considered**: (a) hard-code — chosen; (b) generate from schema — deferred; (c) client-supplied header — rejected (breaks the "no client changes" property).

9. **Supergraph vs. subgraph routing.** Today `POST /graphql` (supergraph), `POST /graphql/r` (reactor), and `POST /graphql/<model>` are all served by the same switchboard per request, so the LB treats them identically. If the supergraph ever federates across multiple switchboards — or if model-specific subgraphs move to dedicated processes — path-based routing re-enters the picture. _Not a blocker for M2; revisit when real traffic or deployment topology forces the question._

10. **GET `/graphql`, request batching, and APQ-only requests.** Today the LB is POST-only with a single JSON object and routable identifier in `variables` (§4.1). Anything else (GET with a query string, JSON-array request batching, persisted-query-only requests with no `variables`) is rejected with 400 because there's no body shape we can extract a routing key from.

    **Decided (2026-04-27):** keep the POST-only contract. We do not synthesize a doc id from a query string, do not split request batches at the LB, and do not parse `extensions.persistedQuery` to look up the underlying operation. The contract published to clients is simple, the failure mode is loud, and the alternative is either a GraphQL parser at the LB (not happening) or a coordinator backend (hotspot, ruled out under §9 Q7).

    **Revisit trigger:** a real client need we don't already control. If introspection over GET becomes important, route GETs on `/graphql` to any healthy backend without body parsing. If batching becomes important, push the split to clients first; only consider LB-side splitting once a measured pain exists.
