# Glossary

A great way to get familiar with the vision, philosophy and terminology of Powerhouse is by reading the [Book Of Powerhouse](./docs/bookofpowerhouse/Overview).
It offers an entry level, non-technical explainer to the high level vision of Powerhouse.

## General Terms
- **Powerhouse** – A network organization that provides open-source software and services to support decentralized operations for other network organizations.
- **Scalable Network Organization (SNO)** – A network organization structured according to the Powerhouse framework, designed for sustainable and scalable growth.

## Organizational Concepts
- **Network Organization** – A group of independent contributors and teams working together towards a common purpose, relying on decentralization and resource sharing.
- **Keiretsu** – A Japanese term referring to networks of independent companies collaborating while maintaining their legal autonomy.
- **Mondragon Corporation** – A Spanish federation of worker cooperatives that exemplifies the network organization model.
- **Genesis Wrapper** – The initial legal entity representing a SNO, usually a Swiss Association that acts as a wrapper around the multisig wallet.

## Governance & Legal
- **Proof of Work Tokens (POWts)** – A legal instrument used to measure opportunity costs for contributors in a SNO.
- **Multisig Participation Agreement (MPA)** – A contractual agreement regulating the responsibilities of multisig signers within the network.
- **Operational Hub (OH)** – An entity within the SNO responsible for managing contributors, contracts, and payments.

## Technology & Framework
- **Powerhouse Framework** – A technical architecture designed to support SNOs by capturing data and automating processes.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** – A pattern that separates read and write operations to improve scalability.
- **Event Sourcing** – A method of storing system state as a sequence of immutable events rather than modifying a single record.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** – A software design approach where system flows are determined by events that trigger actions asynchronously.

## Powerhouse Platforms
- **Dope** – A decentralized operations platform connecting finance, legal, governance, and people ops service providers with SNOs.
- **Modlr** – A builder platform that helps users create SNO software platforms using the Powerhouse framework.

## Software Components
- **Reactor** – A storage node for Powerhouse documents and files with multiple storage adapters (local, cloud, decentralized).
- **Powerhouse Switchboard** – A scalable API service that aggregates and processes document data.
- **Powerhouse Fusion** – A platform front-end that hosts the public marketplace for SNO interactions.
- **Powerhouse Renown** – A decentralized authentication system managing contributor reputation.
- **Powerhouse Academy** – A training platform for onboarding and upskilling SNO contributors.
- **Powergrid** – A decentralized network of reactors that sync with each other.

## Development & Data Modeling
- **Document Models** – Structured data models that define how Powerhouse documents store and process information.
- **Document Model Editors** – An interface or UI to a document model that allows users to create and modify the data captured by the document models.
- **Powerhouse Project** – A collection of document models, document model editors, and other resources being build in Connect Studio.
- **Host Applications** – Applications that use the Powerhouse framework to create and manage documents and data.
- **Packages** – A collection of document models, document model editors, and other resources that are published as a package and can be used in any of the host applications.
- **GraphQL Scalars** – Data types used in Powerhouse document modeling (e.g., `String`, `Int`, `Currency`, `OID` for unique object IDs).
- **NanoID** – A small, unique identifier used to reference objects within the Powerhouse framework.
- **Model-Driven Development (MDD)** – A software approach that uses high-level models to generate system logic and configurations.
- **Strands** – A single synchronization channel that connects exactly one unit of synchronization to another, with all four parameters (drive_url, doc_id, scope, branch) set to fixed values. This allows synchronization between two distinct points of instances of a document or document drive.

## AI & Automation
- **AI Assistants** – AI-powered contributors paired with human contributors to automate tasks and improve productivity.
- **AI Contributor Modes** – Configurable states that determine the AI assistant’s behavior, permissions, and task focus.
- **Task Automation & Scaling** – The use of AI to streamline repetitive tasks, improve communications, and enhance decision-making.
