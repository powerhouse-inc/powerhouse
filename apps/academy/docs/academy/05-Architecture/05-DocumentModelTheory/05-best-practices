## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on best practices for writing Powerhouse Document Models. In this guide, we'll walk you through essential patterns and techniques to help you create robust, maintainable, and efficient document models using the Powerhouse Connect tool.

## Why Best Practices Matter

Following best practices ensures that your document models are consistent, maintainable, and scalable. It helps you avoid common pitfalls, streamline your development process, and produce high-quality, reliable models that can significantly enhance the functionality and efficiency of its integration within the rest of the Powerhouse tool stack.

### Background on Document Models

Document Models are structured frameworks that represent and manage business logic and data. They are more than just templates; they define how data is captured, manipulated, and visualized, transforming documents into dynamic, data-rich resources that drive business processes and automation.

## Best Practices

### General GraphQL Patterns

#### Follow Standard GraphQL Conventions

When defining your document models, adhere to standard GraphQL conventions. This includes using appropriate naming conventions, structuring your types and queries correctly, and ensuring that your schema is both intuitive and efficient.

- **Enum Values in ALL_CAPS:** Use ALL_CAPS for enum values to maintain consistency and clarity.
    
    ```graphql
    enum TaskStatus {
        PENDING
        COMPLETED
        IN_PROGRESS
    }
    ```
    

### Using Slugs and IDs

#### Create Stable, Readable URLs

Using slugs and IDs together ensures your URLs are both human-readable and stable. This improves usability and SEO, making it easier to reference and share resources.

- **Slugs:** Human-readable strings that uniquely identify a resource.
- **IDs:** Unique identifiers that remain constant even if the resource name changes.

### Flux Pattern

#### Implement Unidirectional Data Flow

The Flux pattern is a state management approach that centralizes state updates, ensuring a predictable state flow. This is crucial for debugging and state tracking in complex applications.

- **Actions:** Represent the intention to change the state.
- **Dispatcher:** Central hub that manages all actions.
- **Stores:** Hold the application state and logic.
- **Views:** Render the data from stores.
    
    ```jsx
    // Example action
    const addAction = {
        type: 'ADD_ITEM',
        payload: newItem
    };
    ```
    

### Event Sourcing

#### Store Changes as a Sequence of Events

Event sourcing involves storing all changes to the application state as events. This allows you to reconstruct past states, audit changes, and implement features like undo functionality.

- **Events:** Immutable facts that represent state changes.
- **Event Store:** Repository for all events.
- **Event Handlers:** Apply events to update the state.
    
    ```jsx
    const itemAddedEvent = {
        type: 'ITEM_ADDED',
        data: {
            id: 1,
            name: 'New Item'
        }
    };
    ```
    

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

#### Separate Read and Write Operations

CQRS separates the methods for reading and writing data, optimizing performance and scalability. This distinction helps in maintaining clear and distinct command (write) and query (read) models.

- **Commands:** Handle write operations (e.g., create, update, delete).
- **Queries:** Handle read operations (e.g., fetch data).
    
    ```graphql
    type Mutation {
        createItem(input: CreateItemInput!): Item!
    }
    
    type Query {
        getItem(id: ID!): Item
    }
    
    ```
    

### Domain Modeling

#### Create a Conceptual Model Based on Real-World Domain

Domain modeling involves creating a conceptual model that mirrors the real-world domain. This helps in structuring your system around core business logic and rules.

- **Entities:** Represent core business objects.
- **Value Objects:** Objects that describe some aspect of the domain with no identity.
- **Aggregates:** Clusters of domain objects that are treated as a single unit.
    
    ```graphql
    type Order {
        id: ID!
        customer: Customer!
        items: [OrderItem!]!
    }
    ```
    

### Root Object Naming

#### Use `DocumentModelState` as the Root Object

Name your root object `DocumentModelState` to clearly indicate the primary entry point for state management. This consistency makes your model more understandable and maintainable.

```graphql

type ExampleModelNameState {
    lists: [LIST]
    exampleObjects: [Examples]
}
```

### Composition vs Aggregation vs Association

#### Define Relationships Appropriately

- **Composition:** Use when the parent-child relationship is immutable.
- **Aggregation:** Use when the parent can exist independently.
- **Association:** Use for flexible relationships without cascading deletes.

### ObjectRef vs ObjectInfo

#### Distinguish Between References and Detailed Information

- **ObjectRef:** References the unique identifier of an object.
    
    ```graphql
    type Order {
        customer: CustomerRef!
    }
    ```
    
- **ObjectInfo:** Contains detailed information about the object.
    
    ```graphql
    type Order {
        customer: CustomerInfo!
    }
    ```
    

### Reusing State Types as Input Subtypes

#### Maintain Consistency and Reduce Redundancy

Reuse state types as input subtypes to simplify your codebase and ensure alignment between state representations and input types.

```graphql
input CreateItemInput {
    name: String!
    description: String
}

type Item {
    name: String!
    description: String
}
```

### Minimal Mandatory Input Fields

#### Keep Inputs Optional When Appropriate

Make input fields optional when the corresponding state fields are optional or have default values. This practice ensures flexibility and reduces unnecessary complexity.

```graphql
input UpdateItemInput {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    description: String
}
```

### Array `!` Rules

#### Use Mandatory Arrays Appropriately

- **Mandatory Inner Elements:** Always use `!` for array element types.
- **Mandatory Arrays in State:** Use `!` for arrays in the state with a default value of `[]`.
- **Optional Arrays in Inputs:** Follow the state field with default value rule for input types.
    
    ```graphql
    type Order {
        items: [OrderItem!]! # Mandatory array with default value []
    }
    ```
    

### Input Type-Specific Fields

#### Capture User Intentions Effectively

Use specific fields in input types to clearly capture user intentions, such as removing optional state fields or adding contextual information.

```graphql

input UpdateStatusInput {
    id: ID!
    status: String!
    comment: String # Contextual field not reflected in the state
}
```

### Object References

#### Resolve Object References to Complete Objects in API

Ensure that object references in your API resolve to full, complete objects. This practice provides comprehensive data and improves usability.

```graphql

// Document Model
type OwnerType {
    users: [ID!]!
}

// API Implementation
type OwnerType {
    users: [User!]!
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, you can develop Document Models that are robust, maintainable, and efficient. These guidelines will help you create models that enhance the functionality of your applications, making them more scalable and easier to manage. Happy document modeling!
