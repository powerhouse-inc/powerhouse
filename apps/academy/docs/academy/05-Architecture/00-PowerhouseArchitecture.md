# Powerhouse Architecture

**Vetra is part of the Powerhouse Ecosystem** and acts as the builder platform and builder tooling for scalable network organizations. 

The Powerhouse ecosystem makes use of 4 core host applications that together form a modular, scalable operating system for decentralized organizations. 
Each application serves a distinct role, yet they are interdependent, working as a unified system to streamline operations, enhance collaboration, and drive automation.

These five applications are:

1. **Connect** – The contributor's public or private workspace.
2. **Switchboard** – The data infrastructure and API engine.
3. **Fusion** – The public-facing collaboration hub.
4. **Renown** – The decentralized reputation and identity system.

With the help of these host applications Powerhouse is launching 2 platforms that form an example of the infrastructure that can be build with the Powerhouse techstack.

- [Vetra Builder Platform](https://vetra.io/): Sovereign infrastructure for scalable network organizations that is local first, built to scale. 
- [Achra Decentralized Operations Platform](https://achra.com/): Where open organizations can procure and purchase services.
