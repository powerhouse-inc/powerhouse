# Introducing Fusion

Fusion is a public platform for publishing your organizational data. 
With the help of dashboards, modules & widgets, Fusion helps organizations to structure and summarize data to make informed decisions.
The first implementation of Fusion is live for the [Sky ecosystem.](https://fusion.sky.money)

Fusion acts as the front end that seamlessly makes use of the data you have been collecting, structuring and redirecting with Connect & Switchboard. Although Fusion is not the only way you can launch a front end, it is our recommended host app for visualizing Powerhouse data. 

## Core Features of Fusion 

#### Publish Data to a Public Collaboration Platform
Data which your organization is collecting in the Powerhouse native apps such as Connect & Switchboard or other data streams will be turned into actionable & verifiable insights with Fusion. Fusion is intended as a public collaboration platform to harvest feedback on organizational data, milestones and projects, among others. 

#### Verifiability and Auditing of Organizational Data
With the help of Renown & Connect, a verification trail can be reviewed on the collaborative documents running in Fusion & Connect. Progress, ownership and status of different key initiatives can be tracked via the public dashboard of Fusion. 

### Getting Started with Fusion
