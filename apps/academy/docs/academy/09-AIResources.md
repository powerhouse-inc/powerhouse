# AI Resources

We have a couple of AI resources to help you with your daily work or exploring our ecosystem. 

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| [**Deepwiki**](https://deepwiki.com/powerhouse-inc/powerhouse) | A searchable/queriable wiki to understand our growing mono repo better. <br /> DeepWiki provides up-to-date documentation you can talk to, for every repo in the world. Think Deep Research for GitHub. |
| [**Context7**](https://context7.com/powerhouse-inc/powerhouse) | The Powerhouse Academy is also available as context through the context7 MCP Server. <br /> LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. <br /> Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source. <br /> Paste accurate, relevant documentation directly into tools like Cursor, Claude, or any LLM. |
