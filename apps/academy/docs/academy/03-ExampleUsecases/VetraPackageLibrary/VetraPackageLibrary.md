Packages of documents are a core structuring mechanism in the Vetra framework, allowing developers to group and manage related document efficiently. These packages serve as modular collections of document specifications and modules, ensuring consistency, scalability, and reusability across different applications.


### Example packages

- **Finance Package** – A set of documents or apps handling invoices, payments, budgets, and financial reporting.
- **Contributor Billing Package** – Defines documents for tracking work, invoicing, and facilitating payments (in both fiat and crypto) for contributors in decentralized organizations.
- **Governance Package** – Models for proposals, voting, contributor agreements, and decision-making processes.
- **People Ops Package** – Documents managing contributor profiles, roles, task assignments, and reputation tracking.
- **Project Management Package** – Models for task tracking, milestones, resource allocation, and deliverables.
