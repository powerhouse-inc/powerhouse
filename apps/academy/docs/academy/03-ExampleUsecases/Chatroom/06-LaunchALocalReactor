# Launch a local Reactor

## Up next: Local Reactor

In the next section, you'll learn how to run a local Reactor to test real-time synchronization between multiple users.

This final step demonstrates real-time collaboration by running a local Reactor instance.

In this final section, we'll create a local Reactor instance to test the real-time synchronization capabilities of your ChatRoom. This simulates how messages would sync between multiple users in a production environment.

## What is a Reactor?

A Reactor is a node in the Powerhouse network that:
- Hosts and synchronizes documents across multiple clients
- Manages document state and operations
- Enables real-time collaboration between users

In production, Reactors are typically hosted as remote servers. For development and testing, we can run a local Reactor.

## Start the local Reactor

First, stop Vetra Studio if it's running. Then start the Reactor:

```bash
ph reactor
```

This spins up a Reactor that:
- Runs locally on your machine
- Creates a public drive accessible from your sidebar
- Enables synchronization between multiple browser sessions

## Test real-time collaboration

To validate the real-time functionality of your ChatRoom:

1. **Open two browser windows** with the application
2. **Navigate to the Reactor drive** in the left sidebar (it will appear as a public drive)
3. **Login with different Ethereum addresses** in each window
4. **Create a ChatRoom document** in one window
5. **Open the same document** in the other window

Now you can:
- Send messages from one window and see them appear in the other
- React to messages with emojis and watch the reactions sync
- Edit the chat name or description and see updates propagate

:::info Real-time Sync
The Reactor ensures that all operations are synchronized across connected clients. Each message and reaction is recorded as an operation, maintaining a complete history that can be replayed to reconstruct the document state.

## Additional features to explore

While testing your ChatRoom, try these features:

1. **Operation History**: Click on the revision history in the top right corner to see all operations performed on the document

2. **ENS Integration**: If you login with an Ethereum address that has an ENS name, your name and avatar will appear in your messages

3. **Reaction Toggling**: Click on an existing reaction to toggle it on/off for your user

## Running Vetra Studio alongside Reactor

You can also run Vetra Studio and Reactor together. In separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the Reactor
ph reactor

# Terminal 2: Start Vetra Studio (in a separate terminal)
ph vetra --watch
```

This allows you to:
- Use Vetra Studio's local drive for development
- Access the Reactor's public drive for collaboration testing
- Switch between local and synchronized documents

## What you've accomplished

Congratulations! 🎉 You've now completed the ChatRoom tutorial and learned how to:

✅ **Create a Powerhouse project** - Initialize and configure a new project  
✅ **Define a document model** - Design schemas using GraphQL SDL  
✅ **Implement reducers** - Write the business logic for state transitions  
✅ **Build an editor** - Create a React-based UI for your document  
✅ **Test with a Reactor** - Validate real-time collaboration features

## Next steps

Now that you've completed this tutorial, you can:

1. **Explore the Mastery Track** - Dive deeper into [Document Model Creation](/academy/MasteryTrack/DocumentModelCreation/WhatIsADocumentModel) for advanced concepts

2. **Try Vetra Studio** - Use AI-assisted development with [Vetra Studio](/academy/GetStarted/VetraStudio) for faster iteration

3. **Build your own project** - Apply what you've learned to create your own document models and editors

4. **Join the community** - Connect with other Powerhouse builders and share your creations

*This tutorial demonstrated one of the many ways to use document models within the Powerhouse ecosystem. The patterns you've learned here apply to any collaborative application you want to build.*
