# AI Resources

We have a couple of AI resources to help you with your daily work.

## Deepwiki
A searchable/queriable wiki to understand our growing mono repo better.

What is DeepWiki?
DeepWiki provides up-to-date documentation you can talk to, for every repo in the world. Think Deep Research for GitHub.

## Context7
The Powerhouse Academy is also available as context through the context7 MCP Server.

What is Context7?
LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use.

Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source. Paste accurate, relevant documentation directly into tools like Cursor, Claude, or any LLM. Get better answers, no hallucinations and an AI that actually understands your stack.
