Find a complete overview of how to use the Vetra Studio for you project [Here](docs/academy/GetStarted/VetraStudio.md)

**Quick Start Summary**

- Step 1: Install the powerhouse-CLI: `pnpm install -g ph-cmd`
- Step 2: Initialize a project & directory `ph init my-project-name`
- Step 3: CD into you project directory
- Step 4: Launch Vetra Studio with the `ph vetra`command
- Step 5: Add the necessary document models & editors for your intended solution in Vetra Studio
- Step 6: If you're well versed in schema creation or graphql. Just talk with an agent about your imagined solution.
- Step 7: Start your preferred agent to help you with the initial scaffolding of your schema, operations and reducers. 
- Step 8: Test your implementation in the "Vetra Preview Drive" with the `ph vetra --watch`command. 
- Step 9: Run pnpm build and push your project to a remote repository.Follow the package publishing [Tutorial](academy/MasteryTrack/Launch/PublishYourProject.md)

**Basic tips** 
- 1️⃣ Write a detailed description of your intented functionality inside the document model specification manifest
- 2️⃣ Ask your agent to ask for clarifying questions before starting any ideation process. 
- 3️⃣ For each document model you'll want to create an accompanying editor in vetra studio. 
- 4️⃣ An 'App' specifcation is an drive that can act as an app because of the specific interface you create for it.

## **Hackathon Project Ideas**

Powerhouse is perfect for building:

- **Real World Use-cases**: Every document can act as a mini ledger/blockchain. 
- **Decentralized Applications**: Create apps with built-in version control and collaboration.
- **Document-Based Systems**: Build structured data applications.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Enable real-time multi-user editing.
- **Data Management Platforms**: Create systems with queryable, structured data.

### Coordination & DAO Design

- 🧩 **What if** DAOs weren't chaotic? What documents would you need to make them coordinate like space X and ship like stripe?
- 🎯 **What if** making decisions as a group felt like playing a co-op strategy game. With a clearly aligned vision, instant dashboards and a way to capture hard won knowledge in expertise into custom software for the Dao?

:::tip IDEA
The ultimate DAO Template toolkit where vision & mission documents influence guidelines & onboarding for contributors.

### GovTech & Public Infrastructure

- 🗳 **What if** local governments had to reach consensus with residents before making a decision? How would that look like?
- 🚧 **What if** you could submit pothole fixes or transit complaints into a civic DAO, and track the response like GitHub issues?
- 🧾 **What if** municipal budgets were editable public documents with community feedback loops?

### Education & Group Work

- 📝 **What if** your group project auto-divided work, tracked contributions, and paid out in real-time?
- 👾 **What if** "homework" was a multiplayer quest, and grades came from the DAO?
- 🏫 **What if** we DAO-ified a classroom and let the students vote on rules, roles, and rewards?

:::tip IDEA
The remote classroom SAAS back-end that fosters connection, gives purpose to bullies and empowers younger generation to dream big again.

### 💸 Grants, Crypto, and Incentive Design

- 💰 **What if** grant tooling felt like bounty hunting across a galaxy of projects?
- 📊 **What if** every grant had a live budget dashboard, contributor feed, and impact score?
- 🎮 **What if** you could stake on coordination itself, betting that people will work together well?

:::tip IDEA
The future of grant platforms that dares to imagine grants in new ways. With follow up, tracking and impact visualisations of teams, time, risk & resources invested.

### 💸 Lawmaking, Legislation & Legal

- 🧑‍⚖️ **What if** any government or DAO could fork a legal template, customize it, and track changes in a public, composable way?
- 🎨 **What if** legislation could be transparently co-created by citizens, NGOs, and governments all with aligned incentives?
- 💻 **What if** legislation, contracts & templates could exist on an open-source market place like software?
- 🤖 **What if** a network agent could create a legal vehicle by simply inputing  set of requirements and risk preferences (in non legalese)?
- 🤝 **What if** 2 agents in a network could negotiate terms of an agreement according to predefined functions and risk parameters, without lawyers?
