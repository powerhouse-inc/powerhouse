# Create a new to-do list document

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through creating a simplified version of a 'Powerhouse project' for a **To-do List**.  
A Powerhouse project primarily consists of a document model and its editor. 
As your projects use-case expands you can add data-integrations or a specific drive-app as seen in the demo package. 

For todays purpose, you'll be using Connect, our user-centric collaboration tool and Vetra Studio, the builder tooling through which developers can access and manage specifications of their project. 

## Prerequisites

- Powerhouse CLI installed: `pnpm install -g ph-cmd` or `npm install -g ph-cmd --legacy-peer-deps`
- node.js 22 and a package manager (pnpm or npm) installed
- Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)
- Terminal/Command Prompt access

## Quick start

Create a new Powerhouse project with a single command:

```bash
ph init
```

## Before you begin

1. Open your terminal (either your system terminal or IDE's integrated terminal)
2. Optionally, create a folder first to keep your Powerhouse projects:

   ```bash
   mkdir ph-projects
   cd ph-projects
   ```

3. Ensure you're in the correct directory before running the `ph init` command.  
   In the terminal, you will be asked to enter the project name. Fill in the project name and press Enter.

   ````bash
    you@yourmachine:~/ph-projects % ph init

    ? What is the project name? ‣ getting-started
    ```


Once the project is created, you will see the following output:
    ```bash
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/ph-projects/getting-started/.git/
    The installation is done!
    ```

Navigate to the newly created project directory:
    ```bash
    cd getting-started
    ```

## Develop a single document model in Connect

Once in the project directory, run the `ph connect` command to start a local instance of the Connect application. This allows you to start your document model specification document.
Run the following command to start the Connect application:

    ```bash
    ph connect
    ```

The Connect application will start and you will see the following output:

    ```bash
      ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
      ➜  Network: http://192.168.5.110:3000/
      ➜  press h + enter to show help
    ```

A new browser window will open and you will see the Connect application. If it doesn't open automatically, you can open it manually by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

You will see your local drive and a button to create a new drive.
If you local drive is not present navigate into Settings in the bottom left corner. Settings > Danger Zone > Clear Storage.
Clear the storage of your localhost application as it might has an old session cached.

4. Move into your local drive.  
   Create a new document model by clicking the `DocumentModel` button, found in the 'New Document' section at the bottom of the page.

If you've followed the steps correctly, you'll have an empty document where you can define the **'Document Specifications'**.
