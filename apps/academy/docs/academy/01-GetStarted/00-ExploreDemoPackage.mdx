# Explore the demo package

<details>
<summary>How long will this tutorial take?</summary>

We've designed this "Get Started" track to be as smooth as possible. The time it takes will vary based on your familiarity with modern web development tools.

- **For Experienced Developers** (familiar with TypeScript, React, and CLIs), you can expect to complete the entire four-part tutorial in approximately **1 to 1.5 hours**.
- **For Developers New to This Stack**, we recommend setting aside **3.5 to 4.5 hours**. This allows for time to understand not just the steps, but the core concepts behind them.

This is just a guideline. The goal is to learn comfortably and build a solid foundation with Powerhouse!

A more theoretical and advanced version of this tutorial can also be found in [Mastery Track - Document Model Creation](../MasteryTrack/DocumentModelCreation/WhatIsADocumentModel).

## Let's get started

To give you a quick idea of how the Powerhouse ecosystem operates on document models and packages, why don't you try installing a package? 
We will show you how to install the Powerhouse command-line tool `ph-cmd` and then use it to install a pre-built demo package with a document models, an editor and a drive-app.

## Step 1: Install the Powerhouse CLI

You will use the Powerhouse CLI to launch a local environment with a "To-do List Demo Package".
This is also the package that you'll recreate during the tutorials and gets you familiar with Powerhouse.

```bash
pnpm install -g ph-cmd
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
ph-cmd --version
```                                                   

## Step 2: Install the to-do list demo package

Now, use the `ph` command to install the demo package into a global project.

```bash
# Install the package
ph install @powerhousedao/todo-demo-package
```

This command downloads and sets up the `@powerhousedao/todo-demo-package`, making its features available in your Powerhouse environment.

You have now successfully installed `ph-cmd` and added your first package! 

## Step 3: Run the connect app in studio mode
To run the package locally in Connect Studio (our collaboration and contributor app), run:

```bash
ph connect
```
Click the returned localhost URL and you should see Connect Studio appear in your browser.

</figure>

When you move to the settingswheel in the bottom right corner you'll get access to the **Package Manager**. 
Here, you'll see that you've installed the `@powerhousedao/todo-demo-package`, which contains not only a **Document Model** and its accompanying editor but also a **Drive App** specific to the to-do document model.

## Step 4: Log in with Renown

Renown is Powerhouse's **decentralized identity and reputation system** designed to address the challenge of trust within open organizations, where contributors often operate under pseudonyms. In traditional organizations, personal identity and reputation are key to establishing trust and accountability. Renown replicates this dynamic in the digital space, allowing contributors to earn experience and build reputation without revealing their real-world identities.

:::tip
When signing in with Renown, use an Ethereum or blockchain address that can function as your 'identity', as this address will accrue more experience and history over time.
:::

### Login flow
"**Log in with Renown**" is a decentralized authentication flow that enables you to log into applications by signing a credential with your Ethereum wallet. Upon signing in, a Decentralized Identifier (DID) is created based on your Ethereum key. 

<figure className="image-container">
  <img src={require("./images/RenownLogin.png").default} alt="Renown Login" />
  <figcaption>The Renown login screen, prompting for a signature from a wallet.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Generate a DID to sign operations in Connect
This DID is then associated with a credential that authorizes a specific Connect instance to act on your behalf. That credential is stored securely on Ceramic, a decentralized data network. When you perform actions through the Powerhouse Connect interface, those operations are signed with the DID and transmitted to Switchboard, which serves as the verifier. 

<figure className="image-container">
  <img src={require("./images/ConnectAddress.png").default} alt="Connect Address for DID" />
  <figcaption>A newly generated DID and address shown within the Connect interface.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure className="image-container">
  <img src={require("./images/LoginComplete.png").default} alt="Renown Login Complete" />
  <figcaption>Confirmation of a successful login with Renown.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Verifying signatures
**Switchboard**, our (remote & local) data processing engine, acts as a verifier in the Renown authentication flow. Switchboard checks the validity of the DID and credential, ensuring the operation request is legitimate. This flow is designed to offer a verifiable, cryptographically secure login system that replaces traditional password-based authentication with decentralized identity and signature-based trust.

## Step 5: Create a to-do list and explore the document operations history

<figure className="image-container">
  <img src={require("./images/OperationsHistory.png").default} alt="Operations History" />
  <figcaption>Example of the operations history for a document, showing all modifications made to it in a list. </figcaption>
</figure>

By leveraging this system, every operation or modification made to a document is cryptographically signed by the contributor's Renown identity. This ensures that each change is verifiable, traceable, and attributable to a specific pseudonymous user, providing a robust audit trail for all document activity. 

A key feature you get with Connect is the **Operations History**. Every change to a document is stored as an individual operation, creating an immutable and replayable history. This provides complete auditability and transparency, as you can inspect each revision, its details, and any associated signatures. For example, you can see a chronological list of all modifications, along with who made them and when. This ensures every action is traceable and verifiable.

### 5.1 Create a to-do list

Now, move back to your local drive and create a to-do list. Add a few to-dos that are on your mind. You'll see a statistics widget that counts the open to-dos.

### 5.2 Create a specific to-do drive app

:::tip What is a 'drive' at Powerhouse?
A **drive** is a folder to store and organize your documents in. Powerhouse offers the ability to build customized 'Drive Apps' for your documents. Think of a Drive App as a specialized lens—it offers **different ways to visualize, organize, and interact with** the data stored within a drive, making it more intuitive and efficient for specific use cases. To learn more, visit [Building A Drive App](/academy/MasteryTrack/BuildingUserExperiences/BuildingADriveExplorer)
:::

Since your previous to-do list was created inside a local drive with a general-purpose drive explorer, it didn't look particularly special.

- Now let's create a new drive by clicking the new drive icon. In the **Drive App** field, select 'To-do Drive App'.  
- Now move into the drive you've just created and create a new to-do list by clicking the button at the bottom of the page. 
- Add a new set of random to-dos
- After closing the document, look at the To-do Drive App interface. You'll see that it tracks your tasks and displays a progress bar.

<figure className="image-container">
  <img src={require("./images/TodoDriveApp.png").default} alt="Operations History" />
  <figcaption>A list of todo's in the custom todo drive app. </figcaption>
</figure>

This is the power of Drive Apps. They offer a customized interface that works well with the different documents inside your drive. Read more about drive apps in the Mastery Track: [Drive Apps and Drive Explorers](/academy/MasteryTrack/BuildingUserExperiences/BuildingADriveExplorer).
## Step 6: Export a document

Export the document as a `.phd` (Powerhouse Document) file using the export button in the document toolbar at the top. In this toolbar, you will find all available functionality for your documents. The `.phd` file can be sent through any of your preferred channels to other users on your network. 

### Up next 

Now that you have explored a Powerhouse package and discovered its basic functionalities, it is time to start building your own. 
Our next tutorial focuses on creating a simple to-do list document and will introduce you to the world of **Document Models**.
