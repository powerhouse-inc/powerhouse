# Setup builder environment

Let's set up your computer to start with any of the Powerhouse Connect tutorials. Don't worry if this is your first time setting up a development environment - we'll guide you through each step!

:::warning
If you've already setup git, node, and npm, your most important step is to install the Powerhouse CLI with the command `npm install ph-cmd`. A global install is recommended if you want to use the command from any directory as a power user. The Powerhouse CLI is used to create, build, and run your Document Models and give you direct access to a series of Powerhouse ecosystem tools.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin with any of the Powerhouse Connect tutorials, we need to install some software on your computer. We'll need three main tools: node.js 22, which helps us run our code, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is where we'll write our code, and Git, which helps us manage our code. Follow the steps below based on your computer's operating system.

### Installing Node.js 22

node.js 22 is a tool that lets us run our application. Let's install it step by step.

#### For Windows
1. **Set up PowerShell for running commands:**
   - Press the Windows key
   - Type "PowerShell"
   - Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select "Run as administrator"
   - In the PowerShell window, type this command and press Enter:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
   - Type 'A' when prompted to confirm
   - You can now close this window and open PowerShell normally for the remaining steps

2. **Install node.js 22:**
   - Visit the [node.js 22 official website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Click the big green button that says "LTS" (this means Long Term Support - it's the most stable version)
   - Once the installer downloads, double-click it to start installation
   - Click "Next" through the installation wizard, leaving all settings at their defaults

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open PowerShell (no need for admin mode)
   - Type these commands one at a time and press Enter after each:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   pnpm --version
   ```
   - You should see version numbers appear after each command (e.g., v18.17.0). If you do, congratulations - node.js 22 is installed!

> **Note**: If node.js 22 commands don't work in VS Code, restart VS Code to refresh environment variables.

#### For macOS
1. **Install Homebrew:**
   - Open Terminal (press Command + Space and type "Terminal")
   - Copy and paste this command into Terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   - Follow any additional instructions that appear

2. **Install node.js 22:**
   - In the same Terminal window, type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - In Terminal, type these commands one at a time and press Enter after each:
   ```bash
   node --version
   pnpm --version
   ```
   - If you see version numbers, you've successfully installed node.js 22!

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
1. **Open Terminal:**
   - Press Ctrl + Alt + T on your keyboard, or
   - Click the Activities button and type "Terminal"

2. **Update Package List:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install node.js 22 and npm:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Type these commands one at a time and press Enter after each:
   ```bash
   node --version
   pnpm --version
   ```
   - If you see version numbers, you're all set!

### Installing Visual Studio Code

VS Code is the editor we'll use to write our code. Here's how to install it:

#### For Windows
1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the blue "Download for Windows" button
3. Once the installer downloads, double-click it
4. Accept the license agreement and click "Next"
5. Leave the default installation location and click "Next"
6. In the Select Additional Tasks window, make sure "Add to PATH" is checked
7. Click "Next" and then "Install"
8. When installation is complete, click "Finish"

#### For macOS
1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the blue "Download for Mac" button
3. Once the .zip file downloads, double-click it to extract
4. Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder
5. Double-click the app to launch it
6. To make VS Code available in your terminal:
   - Open VS Code
   - Press Command + Shift + P
   - Type "shell command" and select "Install 'code' command in PATH"

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
1. Open Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)
2. First, update the packages list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install the dependencies needed to add Microsoft's repository:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget
   ```
4. Import Microsoft's GPG key:
   ```bash
   wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   ```
5. Add the VS Code repository:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
   ```
6. Install VS Code:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install code
   ```
7. Once installed, you can launch VS Code by:
   - Typing `code` in the terminal, or
   - Finding it in your Applications menu

### Install Git

#### For Windows
1. Open PowerShell (press Windows key, type "PowerShell", and press Enter)
2. Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Download the latest version for Windows
4. Run the installer and use the recommended settings
5. Verify installation by opening PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   git --version
   ```

#### For macOS
1. Install using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
1. Update package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Git:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### Configure Git (all systems)

Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following commands to set up Git:

After installation, set up your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Verify installation

Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following commands to verify your setup:
```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
git --version
```

You should see version numbers displayed for all commands. You're now ready to start with any of the Powerhouse Connect tutorials!
