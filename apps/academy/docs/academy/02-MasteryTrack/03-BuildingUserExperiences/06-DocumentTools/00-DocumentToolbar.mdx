## Overview

The toolbar is designed to be intuitive and context-aware, offering relevant options based on the document type and your current task. Its capabilities range from basic actions to more advanced document control features.

### Key functionalities in the future will include:
*   **Switchboard API Access:** Access the Switchboard API via its logo in the toolbar. This opens the Apollo Studio Sandbox, pre-populating the DocumentID for your current document model. This feature is unavailable for locally stored documents.
*   **Navigation and Versioning:** Tools for managing [document versions](/academy/MasteryTrack/BuildingUserExperiences/DocumentTools/OperationHistory), such as undo/redo, and accessing the [revision history timeline](/academy/MasteryTrack/BuildingUserExperiences/DocumentTools/RevisionHistoryTimeline).
*   **Document Actions:** Buttons for common operations like exporting or deleting documents.
*   **Information Display:** Shows the document title and may include indicators for status (e.g., connectivity, errors) or active modes.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Integrated search capabilities to find assets or attachments within the document context.
*   **View Customization:** Options to switch between different views or display modes.
*   **Contextual Tools:** Depending on the document, you might find toggles, dropdowns for specific actions (e.g., "Sync Schema", "Fixed Income Purchase"), or buttons for settings and configurations.

The specific set of tools available on the toolbar can be configured and may evolve as new features are introduced. This section will detail the various components and options you may encounter.
