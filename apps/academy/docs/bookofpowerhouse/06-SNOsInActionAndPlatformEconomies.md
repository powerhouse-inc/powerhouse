# Part 5: SNOs in action and platform economies

The **Powerhouse Operations Platform** is the core infrastructure that enables **Scalable Network Organizations (SNOs)** to function efficiently. It streamlines operations by integrating automated workflows, smart contracts, and model-driven development, ensuring efficient and transparent collaboration across distributed teams.

- The Powerhouse Operations Platform
    - **Payments & Compensation Management -** The platform facilitates seamless compensation processing by enabling contributors to receive payments in a structured and verifiable manner. It automates invoicing, integrates with fiat and crypto payment systems, and ensures compliance with contributor agreements. This eliminates manual overhead while maintaining clear records of work completed and payments disbursed.
    - **Intellectual Property & Contribution Tracking -** To support open-source and collaborative innovation, the platform provides tools for managing IP ownership, licensing, and contribution history. It ensures that contributors are properly attributed for their work while protecting key assets that drive long-term sustainability.
    - **Budgeting & Project Management -** Operational Hubs (Ops Hubs) use the platform to allocate budgets, track project milestones, and manage resources effectively. Smart contracts enforce budget limits, trigger payments upon project completion, and provide real-time financial insights. This enables scalable, transparent decision-making and ensures that funding is distributed efficiently across initiatives.
    - The Powerhouse Operations Platform functions as a **full-stack operational system** for decentralized teams, ensuring smooth financial operations, legal clarity, and structured project execution in a distributed environment.
