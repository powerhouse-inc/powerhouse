# Part 2: Powerhouse Software Architecture

Powerhouse’s software architecture is designed to empower scalable, decentralized organizations with a modular, layered approach. It uses document models as the core unit that used across three layers: 
- the **Data Infrastructure Layer**, which handles secure storage and synchronization across local, cloud, and decentralized systems; 
- the **Host Application Layer**, which provides contributor tools like Powerhouse Connect and Fusion; 
- and the Customization **Layer**, enabling bespoke solutions for specific use cases. 

## Software Architecture

### Document Models
    - A **document model** is a structured representation of data and workflows that captures relationships, states, and operations within a system. By treating documents as dynamic entities that evolve over time, document models allow multiple people to contribute, make changes, and track progress in a flexible and transparent way. Document models are central to Powerhouse’s development approach, forming the backbone of adaptable workflows and versatile data management. In environments where contributors work asynchronously and systems must respond to evolving needs, document models provide the flexibility and responsiveness that traditional, static structures often lack.
    - Building on this foundation, Powerhouse’s document models are designed to go beyond static data storage, encapsulating the complex relationships, states, and operations that drive decentralized workflows. Each document functions as a living entity, continuously evolving to reflect updates and interactions among contributors. This allows for:
        - **Asynchronous Collaboration**: Contributors can work on documents without being bound by linear processes. For example, a task document can move through different states (e.g., draft, review, approved) based on specific triggers or events.
        - **Customizable Processes**: Document models are highly adaptable, supporting unique workflows for different teams or organizations. This flexibility ensures that systems can address specialized requirements while maintaining overall consistency and transparency.
        - **Event-Driven Updates**: By integrating with Powerhouse’s event-driven architecture, documents can respond to real-time changes, such as new data inputs or status updates, ensuring workflows remain efficient and responsive.

### Three layers of Powerhouse
    1. **Data Infrastructure Layer -** This layer is responsible for data storage and synchronization, whether locally, in the cloud, or on decentralized storage networks like Ceramic or IPFS. It includes: 	
        - **Reactor**: A storage node for documents and files, supporting multiple storage adapters for various environments.
        - **Powerhouse Network Components**: services required to build scalable networks of Reactor nodes, such as event buses, queues, caching services, and load balancers.

    2. **Host Application Layer - t**his layer provides the tools to build apps and platforms using modular host applications. Each host application is an empty shell that gains functionality through plugins. The key host applications include: 
        - **Powerhouse Connect**: Tools for contributors to perform their roles with tailored plugins for document management.
        - **Powerhouse Switchboard**: A scalable API service for aggregating data into operational, analytical, or other specialized read models.
        - **Powerhouse Fusion**: Public-facing collaboration platforms or marketplaces for the SNO’s platform economy.
        - **Powerhouse Renown**: Decentralized authentication and reputation management for contributors.
        - **Powerhouse Academy**: Onboarding and training tools for contributors, offering tutorials and reputation badges.

    3. **Customization Layer - t**his layer consists of organization-specific plugins and instances of the host applications. It enables customization and deployment of unique platforms for each network organization. Examples include: 
        - **Connect Plugins**: Tailored apps for contributors.
        - **Switchboard Plugins**: Aggregated data and API services.
        - **Fusion Plugins**: Custom marketplaces and user-facing platforms.
        - **Renown and Academy Plugins**: Contributor reputation systems and training resources.
