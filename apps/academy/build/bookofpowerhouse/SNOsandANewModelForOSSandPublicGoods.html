<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) once promised to revolutionize global collaboration by enabling decentralized governance, transparent decision-making, and equitable ownership. However, the reality has often fallen short. DAOs have struggled with legal ambiguity, resource allocation inefficiencies, and broken incentive structures. These challenges have stifled their ability to scale and compete with centralized organizations.</p>
<p>Scalable Network Organizations (SNOs) emerge as the next evolutionary step. Combining the principles of decentralization with the operational rigor of traditional organizations, SNOs provide a structured framework for decentralized governance, sustainable operations, and global scalability. Powerhouse’s vision for SNOs aims to deliver on the original promise of DAOs, empowering organizations to scale without sacrificing their decentralized principles.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_M2vJ" id="core-components-of-snos">Core Components of SNOs<a href="https://staging.powerhouse.academy/docs/bookofpowerhouse/SNOsandANewModelForOSSandPublicGoods#core-components-of-snos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">​</a><a href="#core-components-of-snos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to core-components-of-snos" title="Direct link to core-components-of-snos">​</a></h3>
<p>At the heart of Scalable Network Organizations (SNOs) are five entities, each fulfilling a critical role in scaling decentralized operations. From governance to funding and IP management, these components work together to ensure alignment, collaboration, and financial sustainability.</p>
<ul>
<li>DAO<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The DAO is the governing entity responsible for setting the strategic vision and ensuring alignment across the SNO. Through on-chain governance mechanisms powered by smart contracts, the DAO facilitates transparent decision-making, distributed ownership, and accountability. Members participate in proposing and voting on budgets, initiatives, and key operational decisions, creating a decentralized system where authority is widely distributed rather than concentrated in a single entity.</li>
<li>By maintaining immutable records and eliminating the need for intermediaries, the DAO supports scalable and adaptable governance structures that suit decentralized networks. Its ability to flexibly adapt rules and processes ensures that the SNO remains efficient and innovative as it grows, while retaining the values of transparency and inclusivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operational Hub (OH)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The Operational Hub acts as the administrative core of the SNO, handling contributor relationships, compliance, and payment processing. By leveraging legal structures like Swiss Associations, the OH ensures contributors are protected from liability while enabling the SNO to interact with banks, vendors, and regulatory entities. This hub simplifies complex operations such as tax reporting, cross-border compliance, and contributor agreements, removing these burdens from individual participants.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Operational Collateral Fund (OCF)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The OCF provides the financial infrastructure to fuel the SNO’s growth. It allocates resources to high-potential initiatives and rewards contributors by issuing Proof of Work Tokens (POWTs). These tokens align incentives by linking compensation to measurable contributions, ensuring that individuals and teams are motivated to create long-term value. POWTs represent a stake in the success of the network, making contributors invested in the outcomes of the projects they support.</li>
<li>Beyond its internal role, the OCF also attracts external investment by offering structured opportunities for funding impactful projects within the network. By maintaining transparency in its allocation processes and linking funding to measurable outputs, the OCF builds trust among both contributors and investors, creating a virtuous cycle where capital supports meaningful innovation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revenue Generating Hub (RGH)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The RGH is the SNO’s commercial interface, enabling the network to generate sustainable revenue while maintaining its decentralized principles. It manages licensing agreements, product sales, and customer-facing activities, ensuring that all revenue-generating operations align with the broader goals set by the DAO. By addressing the regulatory complexities associated with handling fiat revenue or contractual obligations, the RGH provides a seamless bridge between decentralized networks and traditional market systems.</li>
<li>The RGH supports multiple revenue streams, including enterprise licensing for proprietary versions of open-source software, subscription models for SaaS offerings, and consulting services tailored to client needs. A portion of the revenue collected flows back into the ecosystem, funding operations, rewarding contributors through the OCF, and sustaining the open-source projects that drive the SNO’s long-term success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IP-Holding Entity (IPSPV)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The IP-Holding Entity safeguards the SNO’s intellectual property assets, including trademarks, copyrights, and other IP rights. It is responsible for enforcing licensing agreements and ensuring that the use of the network’s IP aligns with governance decisions made by the DAO. By employing a dual licensing model, the IPSPV supports open-source availability through copyleft licenses while generating revenue from enterprise licenses, allowing businesses to use proprietary versions of the SNO’s software.</li>
<li>The IPSPV also plays a critical role in protecting the network’s creative assets from exploitation or infringement. It ensures that the IP is managed as a collective resource, aligned with the community’s mission and values, while providing a steady revenue stream for reinvestment into the ecosystem. By separating IP management from operational activities, the IPSPV ensures that the SNO remains focused on innovation without losing control of its most valuable assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_M2vJ" id="legal-foundations-for-snos">Legal Foundations for SNOs<a href="https://staging.powerhouse.academy/docs/bookofpowerhouse/SNOsandANewModelForOSSandPublicGoods#legal-foundations-for-snos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">​</a><a href="#legal-foundations-for-snos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to legal-foundations-for-snos" title="Direct link to legal-foundations-for-snos">​</a></h3>
<p>Legal structures are crucial for the success of SNOs, providing clarity, compliance, and protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multisig Participation Agreements (MPAs) <br>
<!-- -->MPAs are a foundational legal tool within the SNO framework. These agreements define the roles and responsibilities of multisig wallet signers, ensuring accountability and mitigating internal liability risks. By formalizing governance processes, MPAs reduce the chaos and inefficiency often associated with decentralized decision-making. They also protect contributors by clarifying liability boundaries, preventing signers from inadvertently exposing themselves to legal risks. <br>
<!-- -->MPAs are fully customizable, allowing SNOs to adapt them to their specific operational needs. They integrate seamlessly with Gnosis Safe wallets, creating a transparent and secure environment for managing resources.</li>
<li>Swiss Associations <br>
<!-- -->Swiss Associations offer a flexible and cost-effective legal wrapper for early-stage SNOs. These entities provide liability protection, separate legal personhood, and the ability to engage in commercial activities that support the SNO’s mission. Notably, Swiss Associations do not require registration, preserving privacy while maintaining compliance. Their reputation as part of Switzerland’s crypto-friendly regulatory environment makes them ideal for DAOs transitioning into SNOs. These are typically used as legal structures for the OCR and IPSPV, while the OH and RGH may be Swiss foundations but their jurisdiction is likely determined by where inbound and outbound payments are taking place.</li>
<li>Open Source Legal Templates <br>
<!-- -->Powerhouse has developed a library of open-source legal templates to simplify the setup and operation of SNO entities. These templates include Contributor Agreements, MPAs, and licensing contracts, reducing the complexity and cost of navigating legal requirements. By standardizing these processes, Powerhouse enables SNOs to focus on innovation and growth.</li>
