# Part 1: General Framework and Philosophy

Powerhouse emerged in the wake of Ethereum’s DAO movement, which began gaining momentum after the collapse of *The DAO* in 2016. This turning point spurred the creation of blockchain-enabled organizations capable of operating without centralized corporate structures. Over the years, governance systems and decentralized operational tools have advanced, paving the way for the next generation of organizations across chains like Solana, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, and beyond. Powerhouse aims to advance these principles and build large, global organizations around networks.

### Decentralized Operations and Collaboration
    - Decentralization is central to Powerhouse’s philosophy. It extends beyond infrastructure to organizational design, enabling entities to function independently of centralized authorities. Just as Ethereum allows value to be transferred globally without intermediaries, **Powerhouse envisions organizations coordinating workflows without relying on traditional hierarchies or centralized services.**
    - This marks a new era for decentralization—not just in the infrastructure we use, but in how organizations operate and how contributors collaborate. Instead of a traditional top-down hierarchy pursuing a singular vision, Powerhouse envisions a web of aligned, incentivized entities working together to build and deliver products and services. Powerhouse is designed to simplify the creation and assignment of workflows, empowering decentralized contributor networks to thrive.

### Open Source and Transparency
    - Open source lies at the heart of Powerhouse. By eliminating lock-in to centralized services, open-source software (OSS) creates trust within network organizations, as the codebase is accessible to all. Additionally, open-source ecosystems create an environment of rapid innovation and collaboration. Powerhouse goes beyond simply releasing software as open source—its legal infrastructure and innovative revenue models aim to make open-source development sustainable and investable at scale.
    - Today’s organizations often operate as opaque black boxes, forcing consumers to trust that centralized entities aren’t extracting disproportionate value. Inspired by blockchain and DeFi’s transparency, Powerhouse promotes openness as a risk-lowering measure. In DeFi, collateral and liquidity are publicly verifiable on-chain. Similarly, Powerhouse encourages public scrutiny and contributions, where anyone can inspect, analyze, or build without needing permission.

### Coordination at Massive Global Scale
    - Scalable Network Organizations (SNOs), a concept pioneered by Powerhouse, go beyond DAOs by creating a coordinated network of specialized entities. These entities work together to pay service providers, generate revenue, manage IP, and enable strategic investments, all within a decentralized framework.
    - Unlike traditional organizations, SNOs rely on decentralized ownership and operations, which makes them particularly well-suited for managing and growing software platforms with network effects. The corporate structures of the past were designed for a pre-digital world where networks were constrained by geography and jurisdiction. In today’s era of global communication and coordination, we need innovative structures and alignment mechanisms, such as SNOs, to support this new paradigm.
