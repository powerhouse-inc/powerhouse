# Introduction

Forms are essential components in modern web applications, serving as the primary interface for data collection and user interaction. Our form implementation provides a streamlined approach to handling user input, with built-in validation that operates seamlessly under the hood, requiring minimal configuration from developers.

The form components in this design system are crafted with a focus on consistency, accessibility, and developer experience. Each component is designed to work harmoniously within the system, providing a cohesive user experience while maintaining robust functionality.

This documentation will guide you through the implementation and usage of forms, demonstrating how to leverage our pre-built components to create efficient and reliable data collection interfaces.

## Form

All `Field` components must be encapsulated within a `Form` component. The `Form` component provides a `FormProvider` wrapper (from `react-hook-form`) that enables automatic validation while maintaining flexibility for custom validation requirements and specific use cases.

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars"

<Form onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
 {/* your tsx code/fields goes here */}
</Form>
`}/>

You can access to the [React Hook Form data](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform) inside the form or even use the hooks that React Hook Form exposes.
Additionally, the `Form` component exposes a `triggerSubmit` method that can be used to trigger the form submission programmatically and a `formId` prop that can be used to access the form in the DOM.

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars"

<Form onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
 {({ formState: { isSubmitting }, triggerSubmit }) => (
    {/* your fields */}

    <Element onChange={() => triggerSubmit()} />

    <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? "Submitting" : "Submit"}
    </button>

)}

</Form>
`}/>

### Submissions

The `Form` component requires an `onSubmit` prop, which is a callback function that executes when the form is successfully submitted and passes validation. This callback receives the form data and is typed as follows:

```ts
function onSubmit(data: Record<string, any>): void
```

Each key of the the `data` parameter record is going to be the name of each field registered in the `Form`.

> **Important**: For non-required fields, empty values are automatically converted to `null` in the submitted form data. This standardizes the handling of unset fields in the `onSubmit` callback's `data` parameter, making it easier to process form submissions consistently.

#### Submit changes only

The `submitChangesOnly` prop enables selective form submission, where only modified fields are included in the submission data. When enabled, the form automatically compares the current values against the initial `defaultValues` and includes only the changed fields in the `data` parameter passed to the `onSubmit` callback.

Example usage:

<Canvas of={SubmitChangesOnly.Default} withToolbar />

### Form reset

In scenarios where a form needs to be reused multiple times for data entry, you may want to automatically clear the form fields after each successful submission. This can be achieved by setting the `resetOnSuccessfulSubmit` prop to `true`, but in order to reset the fields properly, the `defaultValues` need also to be set. When enabled, all form fields will be reset to their default values immediately after a successful form submission, preparing the form for the next entry.

<Canvas of={ResetOnSuccessfulSubmitStories.Default} withToolbar />

The `Form` component provides programmatic access to form methods, including the ability to reset form fields. You can access these methods through the render prop pattern, allowing you to trigger form resets from custom UI elements or event handlers.

<Canvas of={ResetButtonStories.Default} withToolbar />

Alternatively, you can manage form resets manually by leaving `resetOnSuccessfulSubmit` as `false` (or omitting it) and implementing your own reset logic using the methods provided by `react-hook-form`. This gives you more granular control over when and how the form is reset. For detailed information on form reset methods, refer to the [`react-hook-form` reset documentation](https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/reset/).

### Accessing form state

The Form component provides two ways to access form state and methods:

1. Using the _Render Props_ pattern, which gives you direct access to form state and methods within the form's render function
2. Using _React refs_, which allows you to access form state and methods from anywhere in your component

Both approaches give you access to the full range of form functionality provided by `react-hook-form`, including:

- Form state (dirty, isSubmitting, errors, etc.)
- Field values and validation states
- Form methods (reset, setValue, trigger validation, etc.)
- Submission handling

For a complete list of available methods and properties, refer to the [`react-hook-form` documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/ts#UseFormReturn).

#### Using Render Props pattern

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars"

<Form onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
  {({ /* react-hook-form state/methods are accessible here */ }) => (
    {/* your fields */}
  )}
</Form>
`}/>

#### Using react references

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars"
import { useRef } from "react";
import { UseFormReturn } from "react-hook-form";

function FormExample() {
   const formRef = useRef<UseFormReturn>(null);

   console.log(ref.current?.formState?.submitCount)

   return (
      <Form ref={formRef} onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
         {/* your fields */}
      </Form>
   )
}
`}/>
