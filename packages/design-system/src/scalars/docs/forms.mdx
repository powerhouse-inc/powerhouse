# Introduction

Forms are essential components in modern web applications, serving as the primary interface for data collection and user interaction. Our form implementation provides a streamlined approach to handling user input, with built-in validation that operates seamlessly under the hood, requiring minimal configuration from developers.

The form components in this design system are crafted with a focus on consistency, accessibility, and developer experience. Each component is designed to work harmoniously within the system, providing a cohesive user experience while maintaining robust functionality.

This documentation will guide you through the implementation and usage of forms, demonstrating how to leverage our pre-built components to create efficient and reliable data collection interfaces.

## Form

All `Field` components must be encapsulated within a `Form` component. The `Form` component provides a FormProvider wrapper that enables automatic validation while maintaining flexibility for custom validation requirements and specific use cases.

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system"

<Form onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
 {/* your tsx code/fields goes here */}
</Form>
`}/>

You can access to the [React Hook Form data](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform) inside the form or even use the hooks that React Hook Form exposes

<Source language="tsx" code={`
import { Form } from "@powerhousedao/design-system"

<Form onSubmit={/* your submit function */}>
 {({ formState: { isSubmitting } }) => (
    {/* your fields */}

    <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? "Submitting" : "Submit"}
    </button>
 )}
</Form>
`}/>
