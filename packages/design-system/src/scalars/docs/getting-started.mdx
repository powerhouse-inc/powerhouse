# Scalars

Our design system includes a collection of field components that make it easy to work with 
different data types in your forms. These fields are especially useful when working with 
`Connect` documents and GraphQL schemas.

Each Scalar Field is a React component that matches up with a specific GraphQL scalar type. 
This makes it simple to build forms that integrate with your Connect document schema - just 
pick the field type that matches your data.

The fields are powered by `react-hook-form`, which means you get built-in form validation 
and error handling without any extra work. This helps you build reliable forms quickly 
while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

> **Important**: The Scalar Fields must be used with the `Form` component to work. If you 
> can not use the `Form` component, you can use Scalar Fields equivalents in from the
> `Data Entry` section.

> **Note**: You can use Scalar Fields for general purpose, not only for `Connect` documents.

# How to use

The Scalar Fields are available in the `@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars` package.

```tsx
import { BooleanField, Form } from '@powerhousedao/design-system/scalars';

// ...

<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <BooleanField name="isActive" label="Is Active" />
</Form>
// ...
```

All non-scalar components are available in the `@powerhousedao/design-system/ui` package.

```tsx
import { Sidebar, SidebarProvider } from '@powerhousedao/design-system/ui';

// ...

<SidebarProvider nodes={/* ... */}>
  <Sidebar />
</SidebarProvider>
// ...
```
