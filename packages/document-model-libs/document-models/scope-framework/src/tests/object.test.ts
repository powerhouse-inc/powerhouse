In situations where the Immutable Documents cannot be directly interpreted, the Spirit of the Atlas should be inferred in a way that maximizes Universal Alignment and mitigates risks of slippery slope misalignment.

Nebulae must have a process for directly applying Spirit of the Atlas interpretations in cases of less ambiguity and impact.
