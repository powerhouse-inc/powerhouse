### planning-v1/

Pre-implementation planning documents and specifications written before the reactor was built. These documents contain:

- Original design specifications and interface proposals
- Architectural diagrams that informed the implementation
- Design rationale and trade-off discussions

**Note:** The interfaces and implementations described in these documents have diverged from what was actually built. They should not be used as a reference for current behavior.

For current documentation:

- See `packages/reactor/CLAUDE.md` for a concise architecture overview
- See `packages/reactor/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for comprehensive documentation
- Refer to the TypeScript interfaces in `src/**/interfaces.ts` for authoritative API definitions
