# Refactor v2: Read/Write Split

## Goals:

- Split existing `IDocumentStorage` across read/write boundaries.
- Simplify write storage to store only operations. This will be called the **Operations Store**.
- Simplify read storage, which rehydrates + caches. This will be called the **Document View**.
- A third component, the **Document Indexer**, will be responsible for indexing relationships between documents.

### High Level Overview:

```mermaid
graph TD

    subgraph "IReactor"
        AQueue["IQueue"] --> AJobs["IJobExecutor"] -->|"Write"| AOS["IOperationStore"]
        AOS --> APub

        subgraph AEvents["IEventBus"]
            APub["emit()"]
            ASub["on()"]
        end


        ASub --> ARM["IDocumentView"] <-->|"Read/Write"| IDocumentIndexer
        ARM -->|"Read"| AOS
    end
```

#### IOperationsStore

- [IOperationStore](IOperationStore.md)
- A simple storage of events, indexed by sync unit tuple (docId, scope and branch).
- Minimal query methods to allow hydrating the DocumentViews, so they can rebuild their state when needed.
- This object does not provide any recovery, ordering, or queuing. Instead, the reactor worries about these concerns.
  - When multiple clients attempt to apply operations to the same document, the reactor is already queuing and waiting for each set of writes to the operation store.
  - The operations store throws named errors on revision mismatch issues. The reactor, already queuing operations, performs operation reordering logic to account for the revision changes.
- **Scope-specific only**: Operations are stored and retrieved per scope. Cross-scope concerns (like document headers which track revision across all scopes) are handled by `IDocumentView`.
- It has a primitive LRU cache.

#### IDocumentView

- [IDocumentView](IDocumentView.md)
- Builds and caches documents based on operations history. It pulls this history from the `IOperationStore` , which provides a document's full history.
- **Handles cross-scope concerns**: Reconstructs document headers by reading operations from all scopes (header, document, global, local, etc.) and aggregating cross-scope metadata like revision tracking and lastModified timestamps.
- Based on PGLite.
  - Similar schema to the existing Prisma storage adapter, but no separate drive table.
- Much of the `IDocumentStorage` interface can move here.
- It has a primitive LRU cache.

#### ISyncStore

- [ISyncStore](ISyncStore.md)
- Synchronization is focused on the Operations Store instead of the DocumentView. This would provide a unidirectional flow of data: the queue / jobs would push Operations into the store, the DocumentView would get updates through a subscriber mechanism, and then make higher level decisions about how to rehydrate.
- It has a primitive LRU cache.
- Based on PGLite.

#### Effects

- We’ll need to turn document-level fields into events.
  - INIT with creation timestamp and initial state
  - SET_META
  - Etc
- We’ll need to embrace eventual consistency at a core level, without relying on a single db to keep both the operations and the sync units in sync.

**Open Questions**

- Does Helia or other IPFS based implementations enable a decentralized Operations Store?
  - We’d need to implement some sort of DAG where each node (operation) references the previous one. Then the most recent node has to be published somewhere.
  - We could also look into existing solutions:
    - [Ceramic streams](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/streams-index), that we already use to store the login credentials
