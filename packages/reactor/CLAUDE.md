- Use `pnpm build` to build or typecheck the project.
- Use `pnpm test` to run tests. Use `pnpm test <path/to/test.ts>` to run a specific test file.
- Use `pnpm lint` to lint the project.
- Use `pnpm claude` to build, test, and lint the project.
- Never use `any` or `unknown` types. Always use named types instead.
- Prefer named types and classical OOP over Pick, Omit, etc.
- When handling async operations, do not put more than one `await` inside a single try/catch block. Use separate try/catch blocks for each await so that errors can be made explicit.
- When working on a class implementation, always group public functions together, and private functions together. Public functions should come first.
- Prefer required fields and parameters over optional fields and parameters. Prefer default values, empty implementations, etc. instead of using null or undefined.
- Do not write comments inside of functions. Write comments only at the function or class declaration level.
- Never use emojis in comments, code, or documentation.
- If you are working from a checklist or implementation plan, always check the boxes as you complete the tasks.
