- 📦 Flexible package management system
- 🔄 Document processing and event handling
- 🔐 Authentication and authorization support
- 📊 Analytics integration

- 🔌 Extensible subgraph system

## Installation

```bash
npm install @powerhousedao/reactor-api
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { startAPI } from "@powerhousedao/reactor-api";

const api = await startAPI(reactor, {
  port: 3000,
  dbPath: "./data",
  auth: {
    enabled: true,
    admins: ["0x..."],
    users: ["0x..."],
    guests: ["0x..."],
  },
});
```

## Core Components

### API Server

The API server provides a robust Express-based implementation with GraphQL support, authentication middleware, and HTTPS capabilities.

### Package Manager

Manages document models, subgraphs, and processors through a flexible loading system that supports multiple package sources.

### GraphQL Manager

Handles GraphQL operations, subgraph management, and schema composition using Apollo Server.

The GraphQL and HTTP layers are decoupled behind `IGatewayAdapter` and `IHttpAdapter`
interfaces, making it straightforward to swap the underlying HTTP framework or GraphQL
engine without touching application logic. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a full
explanation of the interfaces, auth threading pattern, and how to add new adapters.

### Processor Manager

Manages document processors and their lifecycle, including registration and event handling.

## Configuration

The API can be configured with the following options:

```typescript
type Options = {
  express?: Express;
  port?: number;
  dbPath: string;
  client?: PGlite | Pool;
  configFile?: string;
  packages?: string[];
  auth?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    guests: string[];
    users: string[];
    admins: string[];
  };
  https?:
    | {
        keyPath: string;
        certPath: string;
      }
    | boolean;
  packageLoader?: IPackageLoader;
};
```

## Development
