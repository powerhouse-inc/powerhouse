# Switchboard E2E Tests

End-to-end tests for Powerhouse Switchboard features including subgraphs, processors, and the reactor GraphQL API.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (from workspace root)
pnpm install

# Run tests with visible browser
pnpm test:headed

# Run tests in background
pnpm test

# Open test UI
pnpm test:ui
```

## Quick Start with AI

Want to write tests with AI assistance? See [GETTING-STARTED-WITH-AI.md](./GETTING-STARTED-WITH-AI.md) for how to use Playwright MCP with an AI agent.

## 🎉 NEW: Using Official TodoList Implementation

We've copied the **official TodoList implementation** from the Powerhouse team's reference repository:
- **Source**: https://github.com/powerhouse-inc/todo-demo
- **Benefit**: No code generation needed - working pre-generated code
- **See**: `COPIED-FROM-TODO-DEMO.md` for full details on what was copied and how

## Purpose

This test suite validates:

1. **Reactor Core** - GraphQL endpoint, drive operations, system queries
2. **Subgraphs** - Custom GraphQL APIs extending document models  
3. **Processors** - Relational DB processors that index document state

## Current Test Status

### ✅ Working Tests (Reactor Core)
- Reactor health check - GraphQL endpoint responds
- Create drive - Drive creation via mutation
- List drives - Query existing drives
- System query - System subgraph accessible

### ⚠️ Partially Blocked Tests (Document Model)
- Create TodoList document
- Add todo items
- Query document state

**Status:** The TodoList document model and subgraph code has been successfully copied from the official `todo-demo` repository and all import issues have been fixed. However, to test these features you need:

1. **Reactor running** with the TodoList subgraph loaded
2. **Relational DB processor** generated and configured (optional for basic tests)

Since `ph-cli` has module resolution issues on the current staging branch, you'll need to start the reactor manually using the built CLI:

```bash
# From the test directory
cd powerhouse/test/switchboard-e2e
node ../../packages/reactor-local/dist/src/cli.js
```

**Note**: We use the built CLI instead of `pnpm start` because `vite-node` is not installed as a dependency.

## How Scenarios Work

The `scenarios/` folder contains plain-English test scenarios following the Given → When → Then pattern. These serve as:

1. **Documentation** - What the tests should verify
2. **AI Prompts** - Feed to AI agents to generate test code
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - What "done" looks like

### Example Workflow

1. Read a scenario from `scenarios/*.scenarios.md`
2. Use AI (with Playwright MCP) to implement the test
3. Add the test to `tests/*.spec.ts`
4. Run and verify

---

## Testing Approach

### API Testing (Primary)
Most tests use direct GraphQL calls via Playwright's `request` fixture:

```typescript
test("Create a drive", async ({ request }) => {
  const result = await graphql(request, `
    mutation DriveCreation($name: String!) {
      addDrive(name: $name) { id name }
    }
  `, { name: "test-drive" });
  
  expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  expect(result.data.addDrive.id).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### UI Testing (Secondary)
For testing GraphQL Playground or browser-based interactions:

```typescript
test("Playground loads", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:4001/graphql");
  // ... UI assertions
});
```

---

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm test` | Run all tests (headless) |
| `pnpm test:headed` | Run with visible browser |
| `pnpm test:ui` | Open Playwright Test UI |
| `pnpm report` | Show last test report |
| `pnpm reactor` | Start the reactor manually |

---

## Configuration

### Playwright (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Starts reactor via `webServer` before tests
- Uses Chromium browser
- Traces and screenshots on failure

### Powerhouse (`powerhouse.config.json`)
- Points to local `document-models/`, `subgraphs/`, etc.
- Used by reactor to load extensions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'document-model/core'"
The generated code uses old import paths. Change:
```typescript
// ❌ Old (doesn't work)
import { createAction } from "document-model/core";

// ✅ New (works)
import { createAction } from "document-model";
```

### Reactor won't start
1. Check if port 4001 is already in use
2. Try `pnpm reactor` manually to see errors
3. Rebuild: `cd clis/ph-cli && pnpm build`

### Tests timeout
Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` or check reactor logs for errors.
